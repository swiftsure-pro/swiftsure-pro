    The process of managing ideas can be best described as an <em>idea or innovation pipeline</em> in which "best of breed"
    organizations apply a systematic and repeatable series of idea management or innovation processes to advance an idea
    from its inception to delivery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Idea management processes vary from one organization to another, and&nbsp;they are dependent on the product management
    method that the organization uses (such as&nbsp;Stage Gate or Pragmatic Marketing).
</p>
<h3>
    Sources of ideas
</h3>
<p>
    As the Product Management Hub diagram in Figure 1 depicts, there can be numerous sources of ideas and product
    requirements. It is essential that the idea management process to be employed for&nbsp;managing product
    portfolios&nbsp;include the identification of the sources from which ideas are required (or expected) to be collected,
    as well as the process by which they will be captured.

</p>
<p>
    A key objective of managing ideas is to establish a process framework that effectively supports the receipt and
    advancement of ideas in a manner that is responsive to market needs and profitable to the organization.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Receiving and qualifying idea submissions
</h3>
<p>
    The process defined for receiving and registering ideas should strive to systematically capture vital information that
    facilitates the validation of the idea's worthiness for consideration. Information such as the market problem
    addressed, strategic alignment, affected markets, risk, and return on investment (ROI) are examples of data points that
    help to ensure that an idea is qualified to be considered for selection.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Prioritization of ideas and requests
</h3>
<p>
    For all product and project portfolios, the challenge is to balance scope against the constraints of schedule, budget,
    staff resources, business needs, and quality goals.&nbsp;For the trade-off decisions that need to be made to achieve an
    optimal balance, you must give consideration to&nbsp;what information and data points must be provisioned so that you
    can judge and measure the relative importance of one idea or request in relation to others.
</p>
<p>
    To enable management to distinguish the relative values of different ideas, it is essential to consider information
    such as strategic alignment, estimated value contribution, risk and cost to implement, competitive advantage,
    compliance and regulatory implications, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
    If the organization has adopted and established SWOT&nbsp;(Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) data for
    its various products, the ability to determine how an idea or request improves a product's SWOT position will also help
    to ensure that the right ideas or requests rank higher in the selection process.

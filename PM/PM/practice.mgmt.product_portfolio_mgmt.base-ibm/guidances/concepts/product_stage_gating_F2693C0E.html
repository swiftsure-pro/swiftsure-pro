    A stage-gate model is a roadmap for progressing a product from initial idea to availability, with specific decision
    points or <em>gates</em> at which you decide whether to approve the product's progression to the next stage. Stage
    gating can reduce investment risk, because you approve funding at incremental intervals, with multiple opportunities to
    review and re-examine a product's execution, expected benefits, risks, and outlook. Not all products will make it
    through all of the gates; some may be stopped at the outset, while others may be stopped partway through.
</p>
<p>
    This concept page defines stage gating based on the Stage-Gate&reg;&nbsp;model of the Product Development Institute (<a class="elementLinkwithUsertext" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#PDI" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">PDI)</a>.
</p>
<h3>
    Stages
</h3>
<p>
    The stages you define for your product will depend on your processes and level of formality. You may define different
    stage-gate models for different types of products.&nbsp;For example, a brand-new product would follow a different path
    than a minor upgrade to an existing product; a highly strategic or business-critical product would differ from a less
    strategic product.
</p>
<p>
    A product typically begins in an idea or concept stage, and progresses through one or more evaluation stages to
    establish feasibility and business case, before a gate approval to release it to development for implementation. After
    a product is in development, it might go through stages for implementation, validation, and approval for release or
    launch.
</p>
<p>
    Each stage consists of a set of activities and deliverables to be completed by a cross-functional team. The team
    gathers information and completes work to reduce project uncertainties and risks and to advance the state of the
    product artifacts.&nbsp;The deliverables are input to the gate decision and to the next stage.
</p>
<h3>
    Gates
</h3>
<p>
    Gates are at specified points of the Stage-Gate model.&nbsp;At each gate, decision-makers assess whether to continue
    investment in the product based on these factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Execution results from the current stage.</strong> Are the required deliverables complete and of required
        quality?
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Current business case.</strong> Will the product produce the desired benefits, return on investment, and
        strategic impact?
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Plan for next stage.</strong> Does the investment for the next stage fit within&nbsp;the
        organization's&nbsp;resource capacity, prioritization, and risk, and is the plan reasonable?&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The outcome of the gate decision is one of the following decisions:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Proceed to the next stage, with continued investment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cancel the project and stop all investment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Suspend the project at this stage for possible future progression.
    </li>
    <li>
        Redirect the product team to revise the work in the current stage and come back with additional information or
        deliverables.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The formality of the gate decision depends on your organization and processes, and that may vary by project type or by
    gate.&nbsp;Although it's advisable to document the outcome of each gate decision, you can do this either formally with
    an artifact state transition or with more informal documentation.

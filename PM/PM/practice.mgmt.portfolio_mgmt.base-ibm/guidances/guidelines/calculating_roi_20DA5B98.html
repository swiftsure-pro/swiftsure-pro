    Overview
</h3>
<p> Return on investment (ROI) is a financial measure that compares the amount 
  of revenue or cost savings derived from an investment with the cost of that 
  investment. ROI is sometimes known as a <em>profitability ratio</em>, because 
  it provides insight into the expected performance of an investment in using 
  the resources of the organization to generate income or other benefits. ROI 
  and other financial ratios can provide management with a valuable tool to measure 
  their progress against predetermined internal goals, a certain competitor, or 
  the overall industry.</p>
<p> Simply speaking, when someone asks about ROI, they are really asking: "What 
  do we get back (the return) for the money that we're being asked to spend (our 
  investment)? What is it really worth (ROI)?" </p>
<h3>
    Formula
</h3>
<p> The formula for calculating ROI for a single time period follows.&nbsp;It 
  requires knowing the initial value of the investment (Vi), the final value of 
  the investment (Vf), and, from those two values, determining the yield (the 
  return) for that single time period.&nbsp;The initial value in the formula might 
  simply be the cost of the investment; whereas, the final value of the investment 
  might be the payback or savings generated by that investment. </p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="./../../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/roi_formula_1.jpg" />
</p>
<p> Thus, the return on investment equals the benefit (return) of the investment, 
  divided by the cost of that investment.&nbsp;This formula is typically used 
  for short-term investments, such as those lasting less than a year. </p>
<p> The formula for calculating ROI for multiple time periods is shown here, too.&nbsp;This 
  formula assumes that there are a number of time periods (n) and that the value 
  of the investment might change over that time period. </p>

<h3>
    Example
</h3>
<p> In this example, we&nbsp;look at the ROI for an IT investment for a three 
  year period, a typical period for IT projects.&nbsp;The costs for hardware, 
  software, and labor are $400K per year, with $50K of license costs added for 
  Years 2 and 3.&nbsp;There is a projected cost savings of $500K during the first 
  year, $600K in Year 2, and $750K in Year 3. </p>

<h3>A more realistic example </h3>
<p> In the real world, the more complex investments become as they grow, the more 
  complex the formula for calculating ROI becomes.&nbsp;If you think about the 
  ROI for implementing a new system, for example, you must take into account changes 
  in productivity.&nbsp;When a new system is put in place, there is an immediate 
  decrease in productivity as the users get used to the new system and new ways 
  of doing their work.&nbsp;With time, productivity will climb back up to original 
  levels and should increase as the new system yields increased productivity and 
  other benefits. </p>
<p> Here is a standard formula for calculating first-year ROI.&nbsp;It uses a 
  few key variables, such as system cost (A), monthly labor cost (B), training 
  time in months (C), productivity loss during training (D), and projected productivity 
  gain after training (E).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="./../../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/roi_formula_3.jpg" />
</p>
<p> The numerator represents the value of the system implementation, which comes 
  from an increase in productivity.&nbsp;The left bracket (B – (B / 1 + E)) is 
  the increase in average monthly productivity.&nbsp;The right bracket (12 – C) 
  is the number of months in a year, minus the months spent in training.&nbsp;For 
  example, if the user needs to spend two months in training to become productive 
  on the new system, then there would be 10 months remaining in the year to benefit 
  from the productivity gain. </p>
<p>
    The denominator represents the cost of the system implementation, which includes the cost of the system and the cost of
    lost productivity (expressed in labor cost) as the users learn how to use the new system.&nbsp;This cost of lost
    productivity is the product of the monthly labor cost (B) multiplied by months in training (C) multiplied by
    productivity lost during training (D).
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    Let's substitute the following sample numbers into this equation:
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    A =&nbsp;cost of hardware and software = $8,000<br />
    B = monthly labor cost = $3,700<br />
    C = training time of 2 months<br />
    D = productivity loss during training = 50%<br />
    E = productivity gain after training = 25%
</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <img alt="" src="./../../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/roi_formula_4.jpg" />
</p>
<p> Using these figures, we would have a first-year ROI of approximately 63%, 
  which would be very attractive to decision-makers.<br />
</p>
<h3> How to use ROI analysis</h3>
<p> Organizations compare the rates of return of different investments to select 
  which investments to pursue to generate maximum return or wealth for the stockholders. 
  Organizations do so by considering the average rate of return, payback period, 
  <a class="elementLinkwithUsertext" href="./../../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/termdefinitions/npv_9E67A924.html" guid="_jw8zgDNyEd6QsN5bdDcYQg">net 
  present value</a>, profitability index, and <a class="elementLinkwithUsertext" href="./../../../practice.mgmt.portfolio_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/termdefinitions/irr_30B1CC83.html" guid="_JYe3gEvHEd6Ona9n0Aj4EA">internal 
  rate of return</a> for various projects.&nbsp; </p>
<p> Keep in mind, however, that ROI analysis, in general, is a rather diverse 
  collection of methods, skills, tools, activities, and ideas that are useful 
  for assessing the relative value over time for an investment.&nbsp;ROI methods 
  are not a single formula nor calculation that will yield a simple yes-no answer 
  to a question of how to invest.&nbsp;The specific method that your organization 
  uses to calculate ROI will depend on the details of your situation and the data 
  that are available. </p>
<h3> Strengths and weaknesses </h3>
<p> <strong>Strengths</strong>: ROI is a popular metric because of its simplicity 
  and versatility. ROI can help organizations in deciding whether they need to 
  pursue an investment, discontinue a program, or identify departments or other 
  assets that yield weak returns, so that they can gain an edge in the industry 
  or over a competitor. </p>
<p> <strong>Weaknesses</strong>: Although ROI tells you what percentage of return 
  you will get over a specified period of time, it does not tell you anything 
  about the magnitude of the investment. Thus, even though a 124% return might 
  seem attractive initially, would you rather have a 124% return on a $10,000 
  investment or a 60% return on a $300,000 investment? That is why you will often 
  want to know the Net Present Value rather than the ROI.&nbsp;Also, because ROI 
  is so simple, it is easy to manipulate for biased reasons and to express the 
  result in many different ways. </p></td>

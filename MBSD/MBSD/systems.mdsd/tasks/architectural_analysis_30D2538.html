<p>
    The System Architecture Overview is created early in the lifecycle of a project, possibly as early as the inception
    phase (in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../systems.mdsd/capabilitypatterns/synthesize_system_architecture_B65AF7C1.html" guid="_f-muUVVwEdqgIdhbAiG50A">Activity: Synthesize System Architecture</a>). It reflects early decisions and working
    assumptions on implementing the Vision, as well as decisions concerning the physical, logical and process architecture
    and non-functional requirements of the system. It is produced by the System Architect, usually in the form of an
    informal sketch. Conceptually, it illustrates the essential nature of the proposed solution, conveying the governing
    ideas and including the major building blocks. The level of formality of the System Architectural Overview is
    project-dependent. For example, in a large, high-ceremony project, it might be necessary to capture the System
    Architecture Overview in the appropriate sections of the System Architecture Document, so that it can be formally
    reviewed. In this case the System Architect has to use a formal (UML) illustration of the tentative solution.
</p>
<p>
    Many systems are constrained to be developed and deployed in an existing environment of hardware, software, and people;
    for these, the Software Architect gathers information about the current environment and captures it in the System
    Deployment Model.

<td><a id="Determine the Initial Logical Decomposition into Subsystems" name="Determine the Initial Logical Decomposition into Subsystems"></a> 
<p>
    In this step, the System Architect has the task of partitioning the system into subsystems (which themselves can be
    further decomposed if sufficiently large or complex). The subsystems collaborate to deliver the behavior described in
    the Use-Case Model, and, in particular, collaborate to realize the operations defined in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../systems.mdsd/tasks/se_define_system_context_1233657D.html" guid="{C66A11BC-B869-4702-AE8D-C8347BD0AA96}">Task: Define the System Context</a>. The System Architect strives to create a set of subsystems that are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Functionally cohesive (have a well-defined and limited set of related capabilities and responsibilities).
    </li>
    <li>
        Minimally coupled one to the other (the communication between subsystems that is required in the realization of
        system operations is kept to a minimum).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Requirements work and Business Modeling work highlight abstractions that are candidates to become subsystems: the
    expression of requirements in domain-appropriate language yield terms for entities that might become subsystems. The
    domain itself, independent of the specific requirements for this system, might also guide the System Architect, because
    there are concepts in the domain that are naturally (and historically) treated as subsystems. Rarely are a system and
    its associated domain so completely unprecedented that there is not some guidance from previous implementations. Indeed
    the domain might be so well explored that the System Architect can say with confidence that certain capabilities are to
    be implemented in mechanical/electrical subsystems, others in software subsystems, and others as manual
    (people/procedural) subsystems.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the domain, and the novelty of the system, <img alt="" src="./../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="_x613Q9nmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">analysis patterns</a>, which capture many of the key abstractions required to model the
    system, might already exist. The Object Management Group is also attempting to define interfaces and protocols for many
    domains, through the work of its Domain Technology Committee and associated task forces. Inevitably, this work leads to
    the identification of important abstractions in the domain.
</p>
<p>
    Approached in this way, the System Architect can avoid a purely ad-hoc functional decomposition (and allocation of
    requirements to subsystems), which often results in a sub-optimal architecture (see <img alt="" src="./../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="_khKN4OM9EdmaZcY4PeqVxA">Concept: Derived Requirements</a>).

<tr valign="top">
<td><a id="Determine the System-level Processes" name="Determine the System-level Processes"></a> 
<p>
    By default, the System Architect might treat each subsystem as an entity capable of carrying out its responsibilities
    autonomously and concurrently with other subsystems, communicating asynchronously with other subsystems as needed; that
    is, the subsystems can be regarded as active, having their own loci of control. From this basic model, other forms of
    computation and communication can be constructed if required. For example, in a software system, if the System
    Architect see fit, a subsystem can be designed to be passive, that is, its operations are executed by processes
    <i>external</i> to the subsystem (including invocations by other subsystems). This might bring some efficiencies in
    execution (by reducing the process context switching overhead), at the expense of perhaps having to protect the passive
    subsystem (or have it protect itself) from corruption caused by multiple simultaneous (and uncoordinated) invocations
    of its operations.
</p>
<p>
    Any processes external to the subsystems are represented as stereotyped active classes, and the drivers for their
    identification are the same as for standard RUP-based software development (see <img alt="" src="./../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="3.5787175388799096E-305">Concept:
    Concurrency</a>), for example, as proxies and interfaces for external systems or hardware (for example, acting in an
    analogous way to a boundary class), or as control or sequencing agents (like a control class), in the end, together
    with the active subsystems, representing internal system activities that need to run (at least logically, and perhaps
    even physically) concurrently.

<div class="stepHeading"> Develop Locality Model </div>
<div class="stepContent">
<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><a id="Develop Locality Model" name="Develop Locality Model"></a> 
<p>
    Using the System Architecture Overview developed previously, the conceptual level of the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../systems.mdsd/workproducts/rup_system_deployment_model_C12856E8.html" guid="{F3EF5651-065C-478F-81CC-D55D90FF0CBC}">Artifact: System Deployment Model</a> is now developed. The System
    Deployment Model is concerned with determination of elements which host the computational work defined by the
    subsystems and their interactions. The System Deployment Model evolves through three levels: Locality (the most
    abstract), Descriptor (where computational nodes are identified, along with their required characteristics), and
    Implementation (at which actual hardware selections are made).
</p>
<p>
    The primary business drivers of the System Deployment Model are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        users (at locations), defined in User Profiles (in the Vision) and use cases and the Use-Case Model
    </li>
    <li>
        business data (in the Business&nbsp;Analysis Model), if a business modeling approach has been employed
    </li>
    <li>
        operation level requirements (in the Supplementary Specifications)
    </li>
    <li>
        constraints (in the Supplementary Specifications)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At this level of analysis, the concern is with the Locality Model. The System Architect partitions the computational
    resources into groups in support of <i>kinds</i> of processing, without, at this stage, constraining the geographic
    location. The Locality Model represents the initial, abstract, physical partitioning and distribution of the system,
    and is concerned with the physical resources of the system (nodes, devices, sensors and their physical connections and
    interfaces, and the physical characteristics of these, for example weight, heat generation, power consumption,
    vibration, and so forth.). The individual localities express notionally where processing occurs (the semantics of
    locality implies a tighter grouping of resources) without defining exact geographic location or how the processing
    capability is to be realized.
</p>
<p>
    The System Architect prepares the locality diagram(s), consisting of the localities and their connections. Like the
    localities, the connections are abstract at this level and simply represent pathways for information, mass, energy, or
    discrete physical items to be exchanged between localities.
</p>
<p>
    For each locality in the System Deployment Model, the System Architect prepares and attaches a description of derived
    supplementary requirements (derived from system supplementary specifications) which specify quality (reliability,
    maintainability, safety, and so on), physical and environmental requirements, and development constraints (cost,
    technical risk, and so forth). From these requirements, the actual characteristics (of each locality) are determined
    (tentatively in this task, more detail is added in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../systems.mdsd/tasks/refine_system_deployment_model_AAD44C73.html" guid="{B8F36D9E-D010-4D38-8E2F-57B28CC16D1A}">Task: Refine System Deployment Model</a>); obviously, these are chosen to
    meet the explicit requirements at least, but can exceed the requirements if sound engineering practice dictates this,
    for example, to cope with unexpected capacity demands.
</p>
<p>
    Localities and connections are tagged (with UML tagged values) with their characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Localities, characterized with&nbsp; 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Quality tags, such as reliability, availability, performance, capacity, and so forth
            </li>
            <li>
                Management tags, such as cost and technical risk
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Connections, characterized with 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Link parameters, such as data rate, supported protocols, and flow rate
            </li>
            <li>
                Management tags, such as cost and technical risk.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When there are no explicitly imposed requirements and constraints, the System Architect has to make judgments about the
    implicit needs (confirming these with the stakeholders) and derive these characteristics accordingly.
</p>
<p>
    Each locality hosts some set of subsystem operations, and the System Architect must ensure that the locality and
    connection characteristics support the putative set of subsystem operations.
</p>
<p>
    Detailed specification of localities and connections is deferred, except where this is important for estimation or
    viability assessment.
</p>
<p>
    Although this is the most abstract System Deployment Model produced in the project, and is produced quickly and at a
    high level, it <i>might</i> identify actual hardware and software products if these are known (or required), or if it
    is important to make these selection decisions at this time.

    The System Architect establishes and refines the system's logical and physical structure and is concerned with the
    optimization of these structures in terms of major system elements and their interfaces, and making trade-offs in
    competing factors and constraints (for example, performance, cost, environmental impact), in evaluating potential
    solutions that produce the required behavior. The System Architects' view spans the entire system and all factors,
    external and internal, that might affect its development. Given the need to maintain this broad view, the System
    Architect rarely engages in depth in the detailed engineering of a system, preferring to leave that to other
    practitioners in the various engineering specialties.

    "The ideal architect should be a person of letters, a mathematician, familiar with historical studies, a diligent
    student of philosophy, acquainted with music, not ignorant of medicine, learned in the responses of jurisconsults,
    familiar with astronomy and astronomical calculations."—Vitruvius, circa 25 BC
</p>
<p>
    Performance of the role of System Architect requires individuals who are well-versed in the several disciplines that
    contribute to systems engineering and who possess strong skills in analysis as well as solution synthesis. The System
    Architect must also be skilled at heuristic and inductive reasoning (on which so much of system architecting depends),
    as well as the deductive reasoning of other engineering disciplines. The system architect is concerned not simply with
    the technology of the solution but many other issues, such as system operation, performance, economic viability,
    manufacturability, and logistical support, and the political, technical, social, financial, and environmental factors
    (among others) that bear on these issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The System Architect has to possess the experience and maturity that allows for objective analysis and trade studies to
    be done to select the best solution from many, with the ability to make good judgments when information is incomplete
    or ambiguous, and the ability to recognize that "best" is often dictated by political and economic as well as
    engineering considerations.
</p>
<p>
    In dealing with systems that are composites of people, hardware and software, the System Architect requires a strong
    sense of the physical limitations and constraints placed on any solution, by the human and hardware components. In
    addition to experience in systems engineering (and knowledge of allied disciplines such as operations research and
    engineering economics), the System Architect should have a strong grounding in software engineering (because of its
    ubiquity in modern systems), as well as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Experience</strong> in the problem domain and a deep understanding of the requirements. This expertise can
        be spread through a system architecture team.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Leadership</strong> qualities, in order to drive the technical effort across the various teams, make
        critical decisions under pressure and make those decisions stick. To be effective, the System Architect and the
        Project Manager must work closely together, with the System Architect leading the technical issues and the Project
        Manager leading the administrative issues. The System Architect must have the authority to make technical
        decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Communication</strong> skills, to earn trust, to persuade, to motivate, and to mentor. The System Architect
        does not have authority by virtue of position, rather by demonstrated ability and results. In order to be
        effective, the System Architect must command the respect of the project team, the Project Manager, the customer,
        and the user community, as well as the management team
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Goal-orientation and proactivity</strong> with a relentless focus on results. The System Architect is the
        technical driving force behind the project, not a consultant or dreamer. The career of a successful System
        Architect is a long series of sub-optimal (but not regularly <i>badly</i> sub-optimal) decisions made in conditions
        of uncertainty and under pressure. Only those who can focus on doing what needs to be done are successful in this
        environment.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The System Architect role encompasses the skills of the System Designer, albeit with a strategic, not a detailed focus.

    If the project is large enough to warrant a system architecture team, the goal is to have a good mix of talents,
    covering a wide spectrum of experience and sharing a common understanding of the systems engineering process. Ideally
    in such a team there is an individual, almost certainly the lead, who owns the overall vision for the project.&nbsp;The
    system architecture team should not be a committee of representatives from various teams, domains, or contractors.
    System architecture is a full-time function, with staff permanently dedicated to it.

<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><b>Relationship of System Architect to Software Architect</b> 
<p>
    There are many similarities in the roles; indeed for projects that are deemed "systems" developments because of their
    size or complexity, but which are, nevertheless largely or completely software, the two roles coalesce. However, in the
    general case, the constituency of the System Architect is larger than that of the Software Architect. The System
    Architect must contend with physically imposed constraints that do not exist in the much more malleable world of
    software. The very flexibility of software though makes possible paths of architectural evolution that previously could
    not be contemplated. Therefore, the relationship of Software Architect to System Architect is not a strictly
    subordinate one: feedback from software architectural considerations can profoundly affect the system architecture; to
    deny this is to run the risk of potentially sub-optimal <i>system</i> architectures based on the simplistic notion of
    software architecture as derivative from the allocation of requirements (by the System Architect) to computing
    platforms. It is true to say though that in a team of System Architect and Software Architect(s), the responsibilities
    of the System Architect role require that the System Architect be <i>primus inter pares</i>, because the system is the
    end-product.

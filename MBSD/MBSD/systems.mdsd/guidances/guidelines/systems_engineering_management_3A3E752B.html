    RUP systems engineering projects are managed in a similar way to RUP software development projects, sharing many of the
    project management activities. There are, however, additional roles and activities in RUP systems engineering, and the
    size and nature of the projects (there might be significant hardware subsystems, for example) means there are other
    differences in management approach (discussed in the following sections).
</p>
<p>
    The <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../systems.mdsd/deliveryprocesses/mdsd_dp_BCE136E3.html" guid="_iwnH4Q7REdygjsWLoA98yA">Systems Engineering Delivery Process</a>&nbsp;section introduces the Model Driven
    Systems Development (MDSD) Lifecycle. This presents, in an abstract way, how the system lifecycle is related to
    subordinate subsystem development lifecycles. To some extent, this is a descriptive convenience: while it is certainly
    possible to realize the organization for a project in this way (and, in the case where the development of a subsystem
    is formally contracted out to a separate organization, it would be realized this way), it is possible to integrate the
    development work much more closely. In this case, a single physical team (as shown below) addresses the development,
    with some resources operating in both system architecture and subsystem development teams, changing RUP roles as they
    do so.
</p>

    <a id="Project Organization" name="Project Organization">Project organization</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The movement from a serialized to an iterative process has profound implications in how a project must be organized. In
    a serialized process, staff are often assigned to a project until their artifacts are complete. For example, the
    engineering staff might complete the specifications, hand them off to the development staff, and move on to the next
    project. In any RUP-based project, no such handoff occurs. Rather, the artifacts evolve throughout the development. It
    follows that the staff responsible for project artifacts, such as the requirements database and UML architecture, must
    be assigned to the development project throughout its duration, although the level of effort varies across the project
    lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    The figure shows the organization for a typical RUP systems engineering project. The organization is collection of
    development teams, each with a project manager and a technical lead. There are also teams that deal with overall system
    architecture and project management.

    A RUP Systems Engineering Organization Chart.
</p>
<p>
    In this team structure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <b>Enterprise Modeling</b> team analyzes the business need and generates business models and/or related
        artifacts such as the system-level Vision document (equivalent to the Operational Concept Document). This team
        therefore plays some elements of the RUP System Analyst role at this level (as well as other RUP business modeling
        roles).
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>System Architecture Team</b> works with the Enterprise Modeling Team to create the system context and derive
        system requirements. The team develops the Subsystem and Locality views as well as their derived requirements.
        Throughout the development, this team serves as a technical escalation point, resolving architectural and
        engineering issues. The System Architecture Team also works with the development teams to specify the software
        component architecture. Team members include the technical leads of the development teams. This team plays the RUP
        System Analyst, Requirements Specifier, System Architect and System Designer roles (sharing this last role with the
        software and hardware subsystem development teams).
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>Project Management Team</b> looks after the standard project issues such as project reviews, resource
        planning, budget tracking, earned value and variances, and coordinated iteration planning. This team plays the RUP
        Project Manager role.
    </li>
    <li>
        For each iteration, the <b>Integration and Test Team</b> receives the code and hardware components from the
        development teams, builds the software components, and installs the hardware and software components in a
        laboratory setting. The team also plans, executes, and reports on the system tests for each iteration.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>Subsystem Development Teams</b> are responsible for the design and implementation of the software
        realization of one or more subsystems. The teams base their work on the derived use cases discovered during the
        flowdown activity. Depending on the size and complexity of the system, the subsystem use cases might be realized as
        class design and associated code modules or the subsystems might be further decomposed into subsystems. In the
        latter case, a subsystem team might be further decomposed into sub-subsystem teams and a subsystem architecture
        team might be created. This process enables scalability of the RUP systems engineering approach.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>Hardware Development and Acquisition Teams</b> are responsible for the design, specification, and delivery
        of the hardware components; this team might install and maintain the system in the field. In other cases, this team
        might handle user defect reporting and provide patches to the field.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <b>Deployment, Operations, and Maintenance Team</b> handles operational issues and serves as a liaison with the
        users.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="Concurrent Design and Implementation" name="Concurrent Design and Implementation">Concurrent design and
    implementation</a>
</h3>
<p>
    One feature of the RUP systems engineering organization approach is that it scales to very large programs. This is
    accomplished by taking advantage of the decomposition of the system into subsystems and localities with their derived
    requirements. Each of these Analysis Model elements is suitable for concurrent design and development. As described in
    the previous section, UML subsystems can be assigned to separate develop teams, localities to hardware development or
    acquisition teams. Each team works from its derived sets of services to develop their portion of the Design Model and
    Implementation Model. This way the design and implementation of the design elements can proceed in parallel.
</p>
<p>
    For very large systems, a systems-of-systems approach can be adopted. In this case, each UML subsystem has its own
    Locality Model. This assignment permits the application of the above organization structure at the subsystem level,
    providing even more scalability.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Iterative Development, Integration and Test" name="Iterative Development, Integration and Test">Iterative
    development, integration, and test</a>
</h3>
<p>
    One central feature of the RUP is that the system is developed in a series of iterations, each of which adds
    functionality. The system is integrated and tested at each iteration. The iteration testing is a subset of the system
    tests. Consequently, the final iteration results in a fully tested system ready for transition to the operational
    setting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The timing and content of iterations are captured in the system development plan early in the project. However, like
    any RUP artifact, the system development plan is updated continually to reflect the emerging understanding of the
    system as it comes together.&nbsp;In particular, the further away an iteration is in time, the less detailed (and less
    reliable) is the planning for it.
</p>
<p>
    As an iteration approaches, its content is captured in a finer-grained system iteration plan, specified by the use
    cases and supplementary requirements to be realized by the components developed in the iteration. Each iteration is
    tested by the subset of applicable system test cases.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Recall that subsystems and localities have derived services that trace from system use cases. This tracing provides a
    basis for derived iteration plans for the subsystems and localities. That is, the content of each system iteration
    determines by traceability the functionality that needs to be provided by the subsystems and localities to support the
    iteration. In practice, the development teams negotiate the iteration content to reflect their development
    practicalities. For example, an early system iteration cannot require full functionality of a subsystem. Compromises
    must be made.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    A good system development plan provides the opportunity to identify and resolve system technical risks early, before
    the typical panic of the waterfall-based integration and testing phase. The technical risks can involve both functional
    and nonfunctional requirements. For example, an early integration can shake out system start-up and fail-over issues
    that cannot be fully understood with detailed design and interface specifications. In practice, the early iterations
    must validate that the architecture is sufficient to meet the non-functional requirements.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Iterative system development might seem more expensive because it requires more testing, as well as a scaffold or a
    simulated hardware environment to support the early iterations. Coordination of the iteration content across
    development teams also takes more project management effort. However, these apparent costs are offset by the savings in
    early identification and mitigation of risks associated with the system architecture. It is a standard engineering
    principle that removing architectural defects late in a project is much more expensive than removing them early.
    Removing defects late also adds uncertainty and schedule risk late in a project.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The role of the testing organization is different than it is in an organization that adopts a serialized, waterfall
    approach. Rather than spending more of the development planning for an overall system integration at the end of the
    development, the organization spends its time integrating, testing, and reporting defects.

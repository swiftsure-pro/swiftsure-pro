<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p> When developing a new system, it is important to understand who the system 
  is being built for. If we know who the key stakeholders and sponsors are,we 
  understand their objectives for bringing the system to life. </p>
<p> But more importantly,we need to identify those who will use the system. Invariably, 
  the system under development will be used by more than one user, and users probably 
  have different reasons for using the system. We need to identify who the various 
  users are so that you can identify stories that are relevant to those users. 
  This process increases the likelihood of making the system more tangible to 
  users, because you start thinking about how to solve the needs of real people. 
</p>
<p> The next sections describe common steps performed in sessions to model user 
  roles. These sessions should be conducted with stakeholders as needed to help 
  the team and stakeholders identify, group, refine, and capture user roles and 
  personas. </p>
<h3> Identifying user roles </h3>
<p> A user role represents a <em>population of users</em> that share similar attributes 
  and interaction with the system.Each user role has different characteristics 
  or attributes that help identify different ways that each interacts with system. 
</p>
<p> Brainstorm with stakeholders and identify the different user roles for the 
  system. Try to identify as many as possible, based on user role characteristics, 
  such as their backgrounds, their objectives for using the system, their levels 
  of experience with using software in general or using similar systems, and so 
  on. Don't criticize suggestions nor be concerned about consolidating user roles 
  at this stage. </p>
<p> For an ATM system, the following are examples of user roles: </p>
<ul>
    
  <li> ATM User withdraws the full balance of his bank account in cash once a 
    month </li>
    
  <li> ATM User withdraws cash every week and pays or schedules payment of bills 
    through the ATM system </li>
    
  <li> ATM operator runs operational reports and maintains the ATM functions </li>
</ul>
<h3> Grouping user roles </h3>
<p> Look at common attributes of user roles so that you can group those who have 
  similar characteristics. Typical attributes to look for when grouping user roles 
  are how frequently they will use the system, how proficient they are with computers 
  and software in general, how much they know about the business domain, and so 
  on. </p>
<p> The previous list of user roles might indicate there are two types of user 
  roles: ATM Users and ATM operators. A careful look at the ATM Users, though, 
  indicates that some use the ATM system for one common operation only (withdrawing 
  cash) and only once in a while; whereas, other users use more of the ATM functions 
  more often. This results in at least three possible user roles: </p>
<ul>
    
  <li> Infrequent ATM User </li>
    
  <li> Advanced ATM User </li>
    
  <li> ATM operator </li>
</ul>
<h3> Capturing user roles </h3>
<p> As part of the identification and grouping of user roles, use an interactive 
  and practical way to capture a list of roles that can be easily changed to accommodate 
  the grouping. This can be done in any electronic format, such as word processor, 
  spreadsheet, or any collaboration tool, as well as in simple ways, such as using 
  index cards that can be tossed around and grouped. </p>
<p> After grouping user roles by type, write a short description for each user 
  role,perhaps on an index card, such as this example:</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    
  <p class="quote"> User role: Advanced ATM User  </p>
    
  <p class="quote"> Likes to pay bills before due date to avoid fees and penalties. 
    Pays or schedules bills to be paid electronically. Withdraws cash once or 
    twice a week to pay daily expenses. Values the availability of ATM systems 
    near work and home more than richness of user interface or speed of transactions. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3> Capturing personas </h3>
<p> A <em>persona</em>, as the term implies, is a personification or imaginary 
  representation of a user role.As you go through the identification and grouping 
  of user roles with stakeholders, it can be helpful to identify and capture one 
  or two personas per user role, because this helps to identify which goals typical 
  users have for using the system and how they will interact with the system. 
</p>
<p> This is an example of persona for the Advanced ATM User role: </p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    
  <p class="quote"> Jill is an independent HR professional who is currently providing 
    services for the XYZ company. As part of her job, she usually spends three 
    to five days week visiting different offices across the state. Because she 
    is out of town most of the time, Jill likes to pay her utility bills in advance 
    so that she will avoid late-payment fees, interest, and penalties. She does 
    not use credit cards, because she is trying to pay off her debts. Jill does 
    not have a computer or easy access to Internet banking services currently, 
    so she cannot schedule payments or pay her utility bills online. She prefers 
    to do handle her bill payments by using ATM systems, instead. Jill does not 
    like to drive in the cities where the offices are located, so she usually 
    catches a train or cab and pays in cash. She also prefers to pay other daily 
    expenses in cash, such as coffee and dinner, which are not included in her 
    <em>per diem </em>expenses rate. For Jill, it is essential to have ATMs conveniently 
    located to pay bills and withdraw cash regularly. </p>

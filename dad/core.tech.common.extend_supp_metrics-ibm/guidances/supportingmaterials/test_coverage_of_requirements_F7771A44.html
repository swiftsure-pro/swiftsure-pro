    Purpose
</h3>
<p>
    This metric exposes requirements that do not have test cases. The ultimate goal of this metric is to ensure that all
    requirements can be validated and that they work as intended.
</p>
<h3>
    Definition
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Number of test cases per requirement
    </li>
    <li>
        Number of requirements with no associated test cases
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Analysis
</h3>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
    Software that implements requirements with inadequate test coverage may not work as intended or may have defects. The
    team should expect 100% coverage of requirements. Verification of coverage requires traceability between requirements
    and test artifacts.
</p><br />
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt" class="MsoNormal">
    With some exceptional cases, such as a requirement that can be satisfied by demonstration, a requirement might not need
    a corresponding test case, but could be verified by other verification method. In this case, the team should make sure
    that all requirements are verified by checking at the Verification matrix report.<br />
    <br />
    Tracing requirements to test cases can yield a 10% to 30% defect reduction over several years. Not all requirements
    will have the same number of test cases or amount of test effort applied.<br />
    <br />
    This pie chart shows the percentage of requirements that have and do not have associated test cases.<br />

<h3>
    Frequency and reporting
</h3>
<p>
    Monitor Test Coverage of Requirements each iteration. For iterative development, Test Coverage of Requirements should
    be close to 100% for requirements planned for&nbsp;that iteration.
</p>
<h3>
    Collection and reporting tools
</h3>
<p>
    Test to Requirements traceability information can be obtained from&nbsp;a Requirements Traceability Matrix. Tools like
    IBM&reg; Rational&reg; DOORS&reg;, IBM&reg; Rational&reg; Requirements Composer&reg;, IBM&reg; Rational&reg; Requisite Pro&reg;, and&nbsp;IBM&reg; Rational&reg;
    Team Concert&reg; can be used to collect the data.&nbsp;IBM&reg; Rational&reg; Quality Manager&reg; provides a Requirements Not Covered
    by Test report.
</p>
<p>
    IBM&reg; Rational&reg; Insight&reg; provides full support&nbsp;for reporting the data.<br />
</p>
<h3>
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        When the metric shows 100%&nbsp; coverage and the team believes that test coverage is good, watch out for the
        following circumstances:&nbsp; 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The quality of the tests themselves may be bad.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most requirements need more than one test case.
            </li>
            <li>
                The requirements may be wrong or misunderstood by the test case developer, so 100% coverage of them is a
                waste of time.
            </li>
            <li>
                100% test coverage is the minimum set of tests or only covers incidental cases
            </li>
            <li>
                The team is trying to get 100% coverage, despite knowing they have bad requirements.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        A 100% test to requirements coverage does not always mean that the requirements are thoroughly tested; the
        following items are indicators of measurement pitfalls and should be used to corroborate this metric: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Defects rejected by the development team with a resolution of “works as intended”, which could imply that
                development team and the verification team have different understanding on the requirements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Defects found after the iteration in which the requirement was tested, the possible reasons are listed in
                the pitfalls section
            </li>
            <li>
                Change requests vs. requirements
            </li>
            <li>
                Acceptance test failure rate<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul></td>

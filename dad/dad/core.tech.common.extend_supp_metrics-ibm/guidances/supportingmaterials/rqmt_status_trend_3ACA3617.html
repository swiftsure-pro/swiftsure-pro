    Purpose
</h3>
<p>
    Teams monitor this metric to understand the status of all identified requirements. Some requirements are approved and
    will be incorporated into the release. Others have been proposed by stakeholders, but not yet approved. Requirements
    move between various other states as they are are being worked on, validated, and tested. The team needs to know the
    state of each requirement and have visibility into requirements status trends across the lifecycle in order:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        to effectively plan and manage the project
    </li>
    <li>
        monitor scope creep
    </li>
    <li>
        identify when corrective actions are necessary to meet release commitments
    </li>
    <li>
        help assess process improvements related to requirements management practices and tools
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Definition
</h3>
<p>
    Count: Total number of requirements in each status (approved, incorporated, proposed, validated)
</p>
<p>
    It may be useful to group by requirement type, such as feature, supplementary, or use case.
</p>
<h3>
    Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    A good way to monitor Requirements Status Trend over time is with a stacked bar chart, plotting the number of
    requirements for each status on the Y axis. A line chart is also useful for monitoring trends over time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Expected trend</strong> - As the project progresses, the number of requirements in the initial statuses such as
    "Proposed" should decrease and the number in later statuses such as "Incorporated" should increase.
</p>
<p>
    A high number of Proposed and Approved requirements remaining later in the lifecycle can indicate a problem. Some
    requirements are likely to not be satisfied. Confirm that there is not a large number of high priority requirements
    that are still in a proposed or approved state. When high priority requirements are not addressed, customer
    satisfaction is likely to be very low and the project schedule is at risk. Confirm that timely reviews of proposed
    requirements are taking place so that stakeholders are aware of the status of their requests (if they will be
    implemented or not). In general, the team should review their current requirements management process to determine if
    process improvements are necessary.
</p>
<p>
    A low number of validated requirements indicates that the team has not performed enough testing&nbsp;on the system.
    Focus on increasing&nbsp;testing efforts. Review <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp_metrics-ibm/guidances/supportingmaterials/test_coverage_of_requirements_F7771A44.html" guid="_IJVvoCthEd6wLLxMlDYvug">Test Coverage of Requirements</a> or <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="_d0AhINt9Ed604v6K1J0s_w">Percentage of Tested to Implemented Requirements</a> to ensure that all implemented
    requirements have been tested.
</p>
<p>
    The following figure is an example of a Requirements Status Trend chart, where the vertical axis represents the number
    of requirements by status.

</p>
<h3>
    Frequency and reporting
</h3>
<p>
    Trends should be monitored at the end of each iteration, and discussed with the team when problems are identified.
</p>
<h3>
    Collection and reporting tools
</h3>
<p>
    Data can be collected with IBM&reg; Rational&reg; ReqPro&reg; and IBM&reg; Rational&reg; DOORS&reg;.
</p>
<h3>
    Assumptions and prerequisites
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Team members are consistently updating requirements information in a requirements management tool
    </li>

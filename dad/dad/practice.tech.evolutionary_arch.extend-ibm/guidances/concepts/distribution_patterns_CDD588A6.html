</h3>
<p>
    Processors and Devices are common stereotypes of Node. The distinction between the two may seem difficult to assess, as
    many devices now contain their own CPUs. However, the distinction between processors and devices lies in the type of
    software that executes on them. Processors execute programs/software that were explicitly written for the system being
    developed. Processors are general-purpose computing devices which have computing capacity, memory, and execution
    capability.
</p>
<p>
    Devices execute software written that controls the functionality of the device itself. Devices are typically attached
    to a processor that controls the device. They typically execute embedded software and are incapable of running
    general-purpose programs. Their functionality is typically controlled by device-driver software.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Distribution Patterns" name="Distribution Patterns">Distribution Patterns</a>
</h3>
<p>
    There are a number of typical patterns of distribution in systems, depending on the functionality of the system and the
    type of application. In many cases, the distribution pattern is informally used to describe the 'architecture' of the
    system, though the full architecture encompasses this but also many more things. For example, many times a system will
    be described as having a 'client-server architecture', although this is only the distribution aspect of the
    architecture. This serves to highlight the importance of the distribution aspects of the system and the extent to which
    they influence other architectural decisions.
</p>
<p>
    The distribution patterns described below imply certain system characteristics, performance characteristics, and
    process architectures. Each solves certain problems but also poses unique challenges.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Client/Server Architectures" name="Client/Server Architectures">Client/Server Architectures</a>
</h3>
<p>
    In so-called "client/server architectures", there are specialized network processor nodes called <b>clients</b>, and
    nodes called <b>servers</b>. Clients are consumers of services provided by a server. A client often services a single
    user and often handles end-user presentation services (GUI's), while the server usually provides services to several
    clients simultaneously; the services provided are typically database, security or print services. The "application
    logic", or the business logic, in these systems is typically distributed among both the client and the server.
    Distribution of the business logic is called <b>application partitioning</b>.
</p>
<p>
    In the following figure, Client A shows an example of a 2-tier architecture, with most application logic located in the
    server. Client B shows a typical 3-tier architecture, with Business Services implemented in a Business Object Server.
    Client C shows a typical web-based application.

<p class="picturetext">
    Variations of Client-Server Architectures
</p>
<p>
    In traditional client/server systems, most of the business logic is implemented on clients; but some functionality is
    better suited to be located on the server, for example functionality that often access data stored on the server. By
    doing this, one can decrease the network traffic, which in most cases is quite expensive (it is an order of magnitude
    or two slower than inter-process communication).
</p>
<p>
    Some characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A system can consist of several different types of clients, examples of which include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                User workstations
            </li>
            <li>
                Network computers
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Clients and servers communicate by using various technologies, such as CORBA/IDL, or RPC (remote-procedure call)
        technologies.
    </li>
    <li>
        A system can consist of several different types of servers, examples of which include the following: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Database servers</b>, handling database machines such as Sybase, Ingres, Oracle, Informix.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Print servers</b>, handling the driver logic such as queuing for a specific printer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Communication servers</b> (TCP/IP, ISDN, X.25).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Window Manager servers</b> (X).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>File servers</b> (NFS under UNIX).
            </li>

</ul>
<h4>
    <a id="The 3-Tier Architecture" name="The 3-Tier Architecture">The '3-Tier Architecture'</a>
</h4>
<p>
    The '3-tier Architecture' is a special case of the 'Client/Server Architecture' in which functionality in the system is
    divided into 3 logical partitions: application services, business services, and data services. The 'logical partitions'
    may in fact map to 3 or more physical nodes.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="268" alt="Diagram is described in the content." src="./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_arch.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/./resources/3-tier.gif" width="175" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Example of a 3-tier Architecture
</p>
<p>
    The logical partitioning into these three 'tiers' reflects an observation about how functionality in typical office
    applications tends to be implemented, and how it changes. Application services, primarily dealing with GUI presentation
    issues, tends to execute on a dedicated desktop workstation with a graphical, windowing operating environment. Changes
    in functionality tends to be dictated often by ease of use or aesthetic considerations, essentially <b>human
    factors</b> issues.
</p>
<p>
    Data services tend to be implemented using database server technology, which tends to execute on one or more
    high-performance, high-bandwidth nodes that serve hundreds or thousands of users, connected over a network. Data
    services tend to change when the representation and relationships between stored information changes.
</p>
<p>
    Business services reflect encoded knowledge of business processes. They manipulate and synthesize information obtained
    from the data services, and provide it to the application services. Business services are typically used by many users
    in common, so they tend to be located on specialized servers as well, though the may reside on the same nodes as the
    data services.
</p>
<p>
    Partitioning functionality along these lines provides a relatively reliable pattern for scalability: by adding servers
    and re-balancing processing across data and business servers, a greater degree of scalability is achieved.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="The 'Fat Client Architecture'" name="The 'Fat Client Architecture'">The 'Fat Client Architecture'</a>
</h4>
<p>
    The client is "Fat" since nearly everything runs on it (except in a variation, called the '2-tier architecture', in
    which the data services are located on a separate node). Application Services, Business Services and Data Services all
    reside on client machine; the database server will be usually on another machine.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="174" alt="Diagram is described in the content." src="./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_arch.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/./resources/2-tier.gif" width="166" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Traditional 2-tier or "Fat Client" Architecture
</p>
<p>
    'Fat Clients' are relatively simple to design and build, but more difficult to distribute (they tend to be large and
    monolithic) and maintain. Because the client machines tend to cache data locally for performance, local cache coherency
    and consistency tend to be issues and areas warranting particular attention. Changes to shared objects located in
    multiple local caches are difficult and expensive to coordinate, involving as they do network broadcast of changes.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Web Application" name="Web Application">The 'Fat Server Architecture'</a>
</h4>
<p>
    At the other end of the spectrum from the 'Fat Client' is the 'Fat Server' or 'Thin Client'. A typical example is the
    web-browser application running a set of HTML pages, there is very little application in the client at all. Nearly all
    work takes place on one or more web servers and data servers.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="174" alt="Diagram is described in the content." src="./../../../practice.tech.evolutionary_arch.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/./resources/dpatt04.gif" width="166" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Web Application
</p>
<p>
    Web applications are easy to distribute, easy to change. They are relatively inexpensive to develop and support (since
    much of the application infrastructure is provided by the browser and the web server). They may however not provide the
    desired degree of control over the application, and they tend to saturate the network quickly if not well-designed (and
    sometimes despite being well-designed).
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Distributed Client/Server" name="Distributed Client/Server">Distributed Client/Server Architecture</a>
</h4>
<p>
    In this architecture, the application, business and data services reside on different nodes, potentially with
    specialization of servers in the business services and data services tiers. A full realization of a 3-tier
    architecture.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="The Peer-to-Peer Architecture" name="The Peer-to-Peer Architecture">The Peer-to-Peer Architecture</a>
</h3>
<p>
    In the peer-to-peer architecture, any process or node in the system may be both client <b>and</b> server. Distribution
    of functionality is achieved by grouping inter-related services together to minimize network traffic while maximizing
    throughput and system utilization. Such systems tend to be complex, and there is a greater need to be aware of issues
    such as dead-lock, starvation between processes, and fault handling.

<p>
    The purpose of the test plan is to communicate the intent of the testing tasks. It is critical that this document be
    created as early as possible. Generating this artifact early in one of the first iterations of the Elaboration phase
    would not be too early. It may be desirable to develop the test plan iteratively, adding sections as the information is
    available.
</p>
<p>
    Care should be taken in clearly communicating the scope of testing, the requirements for test, the test strategies, and
    the resource needs. This information identifies the purpose and boundaries of the test effort, what will be tested, how
    it will be tested, and what resources are needed for testing. Stating this information clearly, will expedite the
    review, feedback, and approval of the test effort.
</p>
<p>
    At the outset of the project, a test plan identifying the overall intended testing for the project should be created,
    called the "Master Test Plan." As each iteration is planned, a more precise "Iteration Test Plan" is created (or
    several test plans, organized by type of test), containing only the data (requirements for test, test strategies,
    resources, etc.) that pertain to the iteration. Alternately, this information may be included in the Iteration Plan, if
    it does not make the iteration plan too difficult to manage or use.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Below are some guidelines to better identify and communicate the requirements for test, test risks and priorities, and
    test strategies.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Identifying Requirements for Test" name="Identifying Requirements for Test">Identifying Requirements for
    Test</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Requirements for test identify what will be tested. They are the specific target of a test. There are a few general
    rules to apply when deriving requirements for test:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The requirement for test must be an observable, measurable behavior. If the requirement for test cannot be observed
        or measured, it can't can be assessed to determine if the requirement has been satisfied.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is not a one-to-one relationship between each use case or supplemental requirement of a system and a
        requirement for test. Use cases will often have more than one requirement for test, while some supplemental
        requirements will derive one or more requirements for test and others will derive none (such as marketing or
        packaging requirements).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The requirements for test may be derived from many sources, including use cases, use-case models, supplemental
    specifications, design requirements, business cases, interviews with users, and the software architecture document. All
    of these should be reviewed to gather information that is used to identify the requirements for test.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Requirements for Functional Tests" name="Requirements for Functional Tests">Requirements for Functional
    Tests</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Functional requirements for test, as their name implies, are derived from descriptions of the target-of-test's
    functional behaviors. At a minimum, each use case should derive at least one requirement for test. A more detailed list
    of requirements for test would include at least one requirement for test for each use case flow of events.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Requirements for System Performance Tests" name="Requirements for System Performance Tests">Requirements for
    Performance Tests</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Performance requirements for test are derived from the target-of-test's specified performance behaviors. Typically,
    performance is stated as a measure of response time and/or resource usage, as measured under various conditions,
    including
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        different workloads and/or system conditions
    </li>
    <li>
        different use cases
    </li>
    <li>
        different configurations
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Requirements for performance are described in the Supplementary Specifications. Review these materials, paying special
    attention to statements that include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        statements of time, such as response time or timing profiles
    </li>
    <li>
        statements indicating that a number of events or use cases must occur in a stated period of time
    </li>
    <li>
        statements comparing the behavior of one item to another
    </li>
    <li>
        statements comparing the application behavior on one configuration to that of another
    </li>
    <li>
        operational reliability (mean time to failure or MTTF) over a period of time
    </li>
    <li>
        configurations or constraints
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You should derive at least one requirement for test for each statement in the specification which reflects information
    such that listed above.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Requirements for Reliability Tests" name="Requirements for Reliability Tests">Requirements for Reliability
    Tests</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Reliability requirements for test are derived several sources, typically described in Supplementary Specifications,
    User-Interface Guidelines, Design Guidelines, and Programming Guidelines.
</p>
<p>
    Review these work products and pay especial attention to statements that include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        statements of reliability or resistance to failure, run-time errors (such as memory leaks)
    </li>
    <li>
        statements indicating code integrity and structure (compliance to language and syntax)
    </li>
    <li>
        statements regarding resource usage
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At least one requirement for test should be derived from each statement in the work products that reflects information
    listed above.
</p>
<p>
    Successful testing requires that the test effort successfully balance factors such as resource constraints and risks.
    To accomplish this, the test effort should be prioritized so that the most important, significant, or riskiest use
    cases or components are tested first. To prioritize the test effort, a risk assessment and operational profile are
    performed and used as the basis for establishing the test priority.
</p>
<p>
    The following sections describe how to determine test priority.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Assess Risk and Establish Test Priorities" name="Assess Risk and Establish Test Priorities">Assess Risk and
    Establish Test Priorities</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Identifying the requirements for test is only part of identifying what will be tested. Prioritizing what will be tested
    and in what order should also be performed. This step is done for several reasons, including the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        ensure the test efforts are focused on the most appropriate requirements for test
    </li>
    <li>
        ensure the most critical, significant, or riskiest requirements for test are addressed as early as possible
    </li>
    <li>
        ensure that any dependencies such as sequence or data are tested
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are three steps to assessing risk and establishing the test priorities:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#Assess Risk">Assess Risk</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Determine Operational Profile">Determine Operational Profile</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Establish Test Priority">Establish Test Priority</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Guidelines for each of these three steps are provided below:
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Assess Risk" name="Assess Risk">Assess Risk</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Establishing the priority for test begins with the assessment of risk. Use cases or components that pose the greatest
    risk due to failure or have a high probability of failure should be among the first use cases tested.
</p>
<p>
    Begin by identifying and describing the risk magnitude indicators that will be used, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        H - high risk, not tolerable. Severe external exposure. The company will suffer great financial losses, liability,
        or un-recoverable loss of reputation.
    </li>
    <li>
        M - medium risk, tolerable, but not desirable. Minimal external exposure, the company may suffer financially, but
        there is limited liability or loss of reputation.
    </li>
    <li>
        L - low risk, tolerable. Little or no external exposure, company has little or no financial loss or liability.
        Company's reputation unaffected.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After identifying the risk magnitude indicators, list each use case or component in the target-of-test. For each use
    case or component in your list, identify a risk magnitude indicator, and justify (in a brief statement) the value you
    selected.
</p>
<p>
    There are three perspectives that can be used for assessing risk:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="#Effect">Effect</a> - the impact or consequence of a specified use case (requirement, etc.) failing
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Cause">Cause</a> - starts with an undesirable outcome caused by the failure of a use case and examines
        possible causes
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="#Likelihood">Likelihood</a> - the probability of a use case failing.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Select one perspective, identify a risk magnitude indicator and justify your selection. It is not necessary to identify
    an indicator for each risk perspective. However, it is suggested that, if a low indicator was identified, try
    evaluating the item from a different risk perspective to ensure the item is really a low risk.
</p>
<p>
    Below are greater details on assessing risk by these three perspectives.
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Effect" name="Effect">Effect</a>
</h5>
<p>
    To assess risk by Effect, identify a condition, event, or action and try to determine its impact. Ask the question:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        "What would happen if ___________?"
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        "What would happen if while installing the new software, the system runs out of disk space?"
    </li>
    <li>
        "What would happen if the Internet connection is lost during an inquiry transaction?"
    </li>
    <li>
        "What would happen if the Internet connection was lost during a purchase transaction?"
    </li>
    <li>
        "What would happen if the user enters an unexpected value?"<br />
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Assessing risk by Likelihood is to determine the probability that a use case (or component implementing a use case)
    will fail. The probability is usually based on an external factors such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Failure rates
    </li>
    <li>
        Rate of change
    </li>
    <li>
        Complexity
    </li>
    <li>
        Origination / Originator
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It should be noted, that when using this risk perspective, the risk magnitude indicators are related to the probability
    of a failure, not the effect or impact the failure has on the organization as was used in assessing risk by Effect and
    Cause.
</p>
<p>
    Correlations between these factors and the probability of a failure exist, as identified below:

                <td width="65%">
                    The probability of a failure increases as the failure discovery rates or density increases. Defects
                    tend to congregate, therefore, as the rate of discovery or the number of defects (density) increases in
                    a use case or component, the probability of finding another defect also increases. Discovery rates and
                    density from previous releases should also be considered when assessing risk using this factor, as
                    previous high discovery rates or densities indicate a high probability of additional failures.

                <td width="65%">
                    The probability of a failure increases as the rate of change to the use case or component increases.
                    Therefore, as the number of changes increases, so too does the probability that a defect has been
                    introduced. Every time a change is made to the code, there is the risk of "injecting" another defect
                    it.

                    The use of third party components typically decreases the probability of failure. However, this is only
                    true if the third party component has been certified (meets your requirements, either through formal
                    test or experience).<br />
                    The probability of failure typically decreases with the increased knowledge and skills of the
                    implementer. However, such factors as the use of new tools, technologies, or acting in multiple roles
                    may increase the probability of a failure even by the best team members.

</h3>
<p>
    The next step in assessing risk and establishing a test priority is to determine the target-of-test's operational
    profile.
</p>
<p>
    Begin by identifying and describing the operational profile magnitude indicators that will be used, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        H - used quite frequently, many times per period or by many actors or use cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        M - used frequently, several times per period or by several actors or use cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        L - infrequently used or used by very few actors or use cases.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The operational profile indicator you select should be based upon the frequency a use case or component is executed,
    including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the number of times ONE actor (or use case) executes the use case (or component) in a given period of time
    </li>
    <li>
        the number of ACTORS (or use cases) that execute the use case (or component)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Typically, the greater the number of times a use case or component is used, the higher the operational profile
    indicator.
</p>
<p>
    After identifying the operational profile magnitude indicators to be used, list each use case or component in the
    target-of-test. Determine an operational profile indicator for each item in your list and a state your justification
    for the indicator value. Information from the workload analysis document may be used for this assessment.

</h3>
<p>
    The last step in the assessing risk and establishing a test priority is to establish the test priority.
</p>
<p>
    Begin by identifying and describing the test priority magnitude indicators that will be used, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        H - must be tested
    </li>
    <li>
        M - should be tested, will test only after all H items are tested
    </li>
    <li>
        L - might be tested, but not until all H and M items have been tested
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    After identifying the test priority magnitude indicators to be used, list each use case or component in the
    target-of-test. Determine a test priority indicator for each item in your list and a state your justification. Below
    are some guidelines for determining a test priority indicator.
</p>
<p>
    Consider the following when determining the test priority indicators for each item:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        the risk magnitude indicator value you identified earlier
    </li>
    <li>
        the operational profile magnitude value you identified earlier
    </li>
    <li>
        the actor descriptions (are the actors experienced?, tolerant of work-arounds?, etc.)
    </li>
    <li>
        contractual obligations (will the target-of-test be acceptable if a use case or component is not delivered?)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Strategies for establishing a test priority include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use the highest assessed factor (risk, operational profile, etc.) value for each item as the overall priority.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify one assessed factor (risk, operational profile, other) as being the most significant and use that factor's
        value as the priority.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a combination of assessed factors to identify the priority.
    </li>
    <li>
        Using a weighting schema where individual factors are weighed, and their values and priority calculated based upon
        the weight.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Installing new software
    </li>
    <li>
        Ordering items from the on-line catalog
    </li>
    <li>
        Customers inquiring about their order on-line after order is placed
    </li>
    <li>

    The Test Strategy describes the general approach and objectives of a specific test effort.
</p>
<p>
    A good test strategy should contain the following:

        strategy</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <a id="Type of Test and Objective" name="Type of Test and Objective">Type of Test and Objective</a>
</h4>
<p>
    State clearly the type of test being implemented and the objective of the test. Explicitly stating this information
    reduces confusion and minimizes misunderstandings (especially since some tests may look very similar). The objective
    should state clearly why the test is being executed.
</p>
<p>
    Examples:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        "Functional Test. The functional test focuses on executing the following use cases implemented in the
        target-of-test, from the user interface."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        "Performance Test. The performance test for the system will focus on measuring response time for use cases 2, 4,
        and 8 - 10. For these tests, a workload of one actor, executing these use cases without any other workload on the
        test system will be used."
    </p>
    <p>
        "Configuration Test. Configuration testing will be implemented to identify and evaluate the behavior of the
        target-of-test on three different configurations, comparing the performance characteristics to our benchmark
        configuration."
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>

<p>
    The technique should describe how testing will be implemented and executed. Include what will be tested, the major
    actions to be taken during test execution, and the method(s) used to evaluate the results.
</p>
<p>
    Example:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        Functional Test:
    </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>
            For each use case flow of events, a representative set of transactions will identified, each representing the
            actions taken by the actor when the use case is executed.
        </li>
        <li>
            A minimum of two test cases will be developed for each transaction; one test case to reflect the positive
            condition and one to reflect the negative (unacceptable) condition.
        </li>
        <li>
            In the first iteration, use cases 1 - 4, and 12 will be tested, in the following manner: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use Case 1: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Use Case 1 begins with the actor already logged into the application and at the main window,
                            and terminates when the user has specified SAVE.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each test case will be implemented and executed using Rational Robot.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Verification and assessment of execution for each test case will be done using the following
                            methods: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Test script execution (did each test script execute successfully and as desired?)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Window Existence, or Object Data verification methods (implemented in the test scripts)
                                    will be used to verify that key windows display and specified data is captured /
                                    displayed by the target-of-test during test execution.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The target-of-test's database (using Microsoft Access) will be examined before the test
                                    and again after the test to verify that the changes executed during the test are
                                    accurately reflected in the data.
                                </li>

            scripts).
        </li>
        <li>
            At least three workloads will be reflected in the test scripts and test execution schedules including the
            following: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Stressed workload: 750 users (15 % managers, 50 % sales, 35 % marketing)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Peak workload: 350 users (10 % managers, 60 % sales, 30 % marketing)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Nominal workload: 150 users (2 % managers, 75% sales, 23 % marketing)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Test scripts used to execute each transaction will include the appropriate timers to capture response times,
            such as total transaction time (as defined in the workload analysis document), and key transaction task or
            process times.
        </li>
        <li>
            The test scripts will execute the workloads for one hour (unless noted differently by the workload analysis
            document).
        </li>
        <li>
            Verification and assessment of execution for each test execution (of a workload) will include the following: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Test execution will be monitored using state histograms (to verify that the test and workloads are
                    executing as expected and desired)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test script execution (did each test script execute successfully and as desired?)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Capture and evaluation of the identified response times using the following reports: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Performance Percentile
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Response Time
                        </li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <br />
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

<h4>
    <a id="Completion Criteria" name="Completion Criteria">Completion Criteria</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Completion criteria are stated to for two purposes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        identify acceptable product quality
    </li>
    <li>
        identify when the test effort has been successfully implemented
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A clear statement of completion criteria should include the following items:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        function, behavior, or condition being measured
    </li>
    <li>
        method of measurement
    </li>
    <li>
        criteria or degree of conformance to measurement
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Example 1
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All planned test cases have been executed
    </li>
    <li>
        All identified defects have been addressed to an agreed upon resolution
    </li>
    <li>
        All planned test cases have been re-executed and all known defects have been addressed as agreed on, and no new
        defects have been discovered
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Example 2
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All high priority test cases have been executed.
    </li>
    <li>
        All identified defects have been addressed to an agreed upon resolution.
    </li>
    <li>
        All Severity 1 or 2 defects have been resolved (status = fixed or postponed).
    </li>
    <li>
        All high priority test cases have been re-executed and all known defects have addressed as agreed upon, and no new
        defects have been discovered.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Example 3
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        All planned test cases have been executed.
    </li>
    <li>
        All identified defects have been addressed to an agreed upon resolution.
    </li>
    <li>
        All Severity 1 or 2 defects have been resolved (status = verified or postponed).
    </li>
    <li>
        All high priority test cases have been re-executed and all known defects have addressed as agreed upon, and no new
        defects have been discovered.
    </li>

<h4>
    <a id="Special Considerations" name="Special Considerations">Special Considerations</a>
</h4>
<p>
    This section should identify any influences or dependencies which may impact or influence the test effort describe in
    the test strategy. Influences might include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        human resources (such as availability or need for non-test resources to support / participate in test)
    </li>
    <li>
        constraints, (such as equipment limitations or availability, or the need / lack of special equipment)
    </li>
    <li>
        special requirements, such as test scheduling or access to systems
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Test databases will require the support of a database designer / administrator to create, update, and refresh test
        data.
    </li>
    <li>
        System performance testing will use the servers on the existing network (which supports non-test traffic). Testing
        will need to be scheduled after hours to ensure no non-test traffic on the network.
    </li>
    <li>
        The target-of-test must synchronize the legacy system (or synchronization simulated) for full functional testing to
        be implemented and executed
    </li>

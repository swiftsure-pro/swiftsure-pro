<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><h3> User story </h3>
<p> A user story is a brief description of a system requirement from the user's 
  or stakeholder's perspective.&nbsp;User stories can be defined at a high level 
  and decomposed as needed into smaller stories.&nbsp;User stories are a simple 
  and straightforward way to document requirements.&nbsp;Because they are brief, 
  the overhead is low for creating and updating them as requirements change.&nbsp;Because 
  they are focused on delivering value, they are a good basis for prioritizing 
  and implementing. </p>
<p> User stories&nbsp;work well when a complete detailed requirements specification 
  is not required or desired. They tend to be relatively informal and incomplete, 
  leaving details to be resolved during implementation.&nbsp;A story does not 
  include all of the information that makes up the requirement. It is just enough 
  information to identify the requirement and to remind everyone what the story 
  is about. Writing can be supplemented by a photo when that makes sense. This 
  helps the team think of the product in terms of solving needs of real people. 
</p>
<p>
    Examples:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    
  <li> As an ATM user, I want to use my debit card to pay my electricity bill.</li>
  <li> As a branch manager, I want to track transactions at my branch so that 
    I can identify customers to upsell.</li>
  <li> As a student, I want to enroll in a course so I can complete my degree.</li>
  <li> As an online customer, I want to search for items so I can add them to 
    my order.&nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<h3> User role&nbsp; </h3>
<p> A user <em>role</em> represents a population of users that share similar attributes 
  and interaction with the system.&nbsp;Each different user role has different 
  characteristics or attributes that help identify different ways&nbsp;that each 
  interacts with system. The use of roles while writing user stories helps us 
  avoid writing the stories from a single user's perspective. It is typical that 
  we start by identifying&nbsp;individual users of the system, then we need to 
  organize, consolidate, and refine them into more generic user roles. </p>
<h3>
    Conversation
</h3>
<p> Another important concept is not to worry about getting all of the details 
  into the story.&nbsp;It really needs to be a commitment to have a conversation 
  (actually, a lot of them).&nbsp;Stakeholders can make up&nbsp;their minds as 
  the story is in development.&nbsp;Likewise, as&nbsp;developers need more information 
  or need to ask questions, they should ask (and not expect everything to be spelled 
  out up front for estimating purposes).&nbsp;What's important is to foster a 
  healthy communication between&nbsp;stakeholders (or their proxies)&nbsp;and 
  product owners&nbsp;with the development team.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h3>
    Confirmation
</h3>
<p> It's&nbsp;usual that agile teams do a lot more testing along the lines of 
  development, compared to traditional teams.&nbsp;In fact, they often write a 
  test before they write sufficient production code to fulfill that test, and 
  then they proceed develop the next iteration.&nbsp;These teams&nbsp;work very 
  closely together and, ideally, work closely with their stakeholders. Changing 
  requirements are seen as a competitive advantage, not as something that you 
  need to prevent, as long as you can act on them. Agile teams deliver working 
  software at every iteration, thereby providing concrete evidence of actual progress 
  on the project. Daily builds, or even builds multiple times a day, are highly 
  desirable. Shorter iterations are desirable, from as short as one to two weeks. 
  Four week-long iterations&nbsp;are a common recommendation, although iterations 
  of up to&nbsp;eight weeks will occur at scale. </p>

    There are different ways to approach this step, and much of the approach will depend on your project culture. Where
    available, gather and collate progress reports prepared by individual team members or sub-teams. Project time sheets
    are another possible source to consider. If project scheduling systems such as Microsoft&reg; Project are actively used and
    updated with actual progress, this provides another useful information source. Where available and actively used, you
    might also derive objective status or progress metrics from configuration and change management systems.
</p>
<p>
    For this step and subsequent steps that deal with gathering information and assessing the test effort, try to obtain a
    balanced view, incorporating both objective and subjective measures. Remember that objective numbers only give part of
    the picture, and need to be supported and explained by the current project "climate". Conversely, do not rely purely on
    hearsay and subjective speculation about the test effort: look for supporting objective evidence. Supplement your
    objective data by discussion with either team leads or (where possible) individual team members to gather subjective
    assessments and gauge how much confidence you can place in the objective data.

    Investigate how much effort has been spent on the identification, definition, design, implementation, and execution of

    others. Look also for areas where effort may be unproductive, or not showing sufficient benefit for the level of effort
    being expended.
</p>
<p>
    Look also at the effectiveness of the testing. Look for data that supports your initial observations of effectiveness.
    Consider aspects such as defect discovery rate, defect severity counts, duplicate defect statistics, and defects
    detected as test escapes.

<div class="stepHeading">Gather Change Request Distribution, Trend and Aging Metrics</div>
<div class="stepContent">
<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    Identify important trends evident in the Change Request data. In general, it is less important for this task to spend
    time analyzing data volumes, and more important to identify what the relative data trends are indicating. Look for
    positive signs such as a steady, continuous rate of defect discovery, or a light ongoing increase or decrease in
    discovery rate over time. Be on the lookout for sharp peaks and troughs in discovery rate that indicate the test team
    may be encountering process, environmental, political, or other problems that are reducing their productivity.
</p>
<p>
    Look at trends in defect closures. Look for significant increases of closures by development staff as "not
    reproducible": Identify cases where this is a result of the test team not performing sufficient analysis of the
    failure, and quantify the extent of this problem. Look at trends in defects being closed by development staff as
    "functioning as designed": Identify cases where this is a result of the test team not performing sufficient analysis of
    the specification, and quantify the extent of this problem. Be careful to confirm that these indications are not false,
    and due instead to overworked developers triaging their workload. You should also perform some analysis of defect
    verification trends, as fixes to defects are released to the test team in subsequent builds: look out for trends that
    indicate that defects awaiting verification by the test team are aging or growing to an unmanageable number.
</p>
<p>
    Look for other trends that indicate problems. Look at the the way in which defects and other change requests have been
    recorded or managed by the test team: ambiguous and insufficient information on a change request is difficult and
    frustrating for a developer to take action on. The team should take care to monitor that the quality of the information
    recorded against defects remains (on average) relatively high. Take the opportunity to improve the clarity of the
    associated Change Requests, eliminating ambiguity and emotive language and reasoning. Work together with the
    individuals who created these work products to ensure that the essence of the problem is clearly stated, and encourage
    them to find factual and accurate ways to approach discussing the Issues.
</p>
<p>
    Also look out for imbalances in defect distribution on a number of different dimensions. Look for functional areas of
    the application or the specification that have low defect counts raised against them: this may indicate an exposure
    that insufficient testing has been undertaken in that functional area. Look also at distribution by test team members:
    there may be indications that individual team members are overworked, and that productivity is suffering.

    Analyze the state of the traceability relationships between the testing assets (Test Ideas, Test Motivators, Test

    for signs that indicate that the test effort is focused on the correct areas and a useful set of motivations. Look also
    for negative indications that suggest certain aspects of testing are missing, or are no longer of importance: If the
    requirements or development teams are working on areas not represented by the current test effort, this should raise
    concerns.

    Based on your analysis and the feedback that you have received from various stakeholders, identify opportunities for
    improvement. Look for ways to make the testing more effective, productive, and efficient. This might involve:
    reassigning staff (including pairing staff to work more effectively, or employing specialized contractors), using
    productivity tools to improve efficiency, and finding alternative approaches and techniques that are more productive in
    terms of finding defects.
</p>
<p>
    In most cases, it is better to make small, incremental improvements to the test effort and avoid the risk of derailing
    the project with large, unsettling changes; in some cases, a bigger change is warranted and useful. Use your best
    judgment to formulate an appropriate approach to improvement, and discuss your ideas with other management staff to get
    their input before committing the team to embrace large changes.

    actively monitor the progress being made in adopting the changes yourself, or appoint someone else on the team to do
    so.
</p>
<p>
    Most changes meet resistance or problems that must be overcome for them to be ultimately successful. Allow time for,
    and be prepared to quickly address, any issues that arise and prevent the initiative from succeeding. Be sensitive to
    peoples' natural reluctance to change, and find ways to address their concerns appropriately.

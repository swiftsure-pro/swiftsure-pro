    The fundamental purpose of storyboarding is to take someone's vision of carrying out an activity and communicating that
    vision to developers who can create that vision.<br />
    <br />
    Storyboarding is a technique, within requirements definition, that is used to both discover and to clarify
    requirements. This technique can be used at many points within a development lifecycle and is equally relevant for
    Systems development as it is for software development.<br />
    <br />
    Storyboarding may take place as early as the Inception Phase to identify what capabilities (goals) the stakeholder may
    wish obtain. At this phase in development the 'System' (whether it includes hardware or just software) does not exist.
    Alternatively it could take place later in the development and would be used to clarify how something (user) may
    interact with the item being developed (User Interface). Therefore, the purposes for storyboarding will be different at
    various phases in the development.<br />
    <br />
    Before storyboarding should take place it is essential that the problem to be solved is clearly identified. Once the
    problem has been identified then the purpose of the storyboard can be defined. The purpose should clearly 'bound' the
    area under investigation so providing the scope for the storyboarding. Within this 'bounding' any constraints that may
    be applicable for the storyboard should be identified.<br />
    <br />
    Following the completion of a storyboard, checks should be made to verify that the purpose of the storyboard has been
    resolved. It is essential that the stakeholders involved in storyboarding take ownership of the developed storyboard,
    in effect, 'signing up' to the storyboard validating that it correctly expresses their thoughts. To enable ownership it
    is essential that the storyboard is developed using terms that they understand.<br />
    <br />
    The end state of the item under investigation should be documented and any further potential related storyboards should
    also be identified (maybe because of dependencies). A list of assumptions made during the storyboard should be gathered
    (which can later be verified as being correct) plus any constraints discovered during the storyboarding.<br />
    <br />
    Following the storyboard, requirements should be generated from the results of the storyboard with traceability (back
    to the specific element within the storyboard) and agreed with the stakeholder. These requirements would then be placed
    within the appropriate requirements set from which the need for the storyboard first emerged.<br />
    <br />
    A typical template for creating a storyboard would include the pre and post conditions as detailed below:<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Pre Conditions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>1. Define the Problem</em><br />
    It is important to fully understand the problem to be addressed. If storyboarding is being employed during the
    Inception Phase, it is likely that the problem being addressed is to identify what 'capabilities' the stakeholder will
    obtain. This may be initiated from original stakeholder needs. If storyboarding is taking place later in the
    development lifecycle, then it is more likely that the problem being addressed will involve identification of some
    feature or behavior of something under development.<br />
    <br />
    Inception Phase Example: The retail shopper statement of need - I wish to shop for items from retail outlets without
    leaving my home.<br />
    Elaboration Phase Example: Implementation centric need - How can the music enthusiast confirm whether he will enjoy the
    item he is purchasing?<br />
    <br />
    <em>2. Define the Purpose of Storyboarding</em><br />
    The storyboard to be developed should focus on the problem identified; however, the problem being resolved may need a
    number of stakeholder viewpoints to be considered. Therefore, it may be that several storyboards have to be created to
    fully address the problem under investigation. Stakeholders and analysts must understand the boundary of the
    storyboard. This is best defined by clearly stating the purpose for the specific storyboard.<br />
    <br />
    Inception Phase Example: To identify how a classical music enthusiast may wish to purchase music from retail outlets
    while remaining at home<br />
    Elaboration Phase Example: To identify the location, appearance and occurrence of the 'Sample play' function within the
    on-line market GUI<br />
    <br />
    <em>3. Define Type of Storyboarding</em><br />
    There are fundamentally two types of storyboard. These are Requirements Discovery storyboards or Requirements
    Clarification storyboards. These storyboards would cover all examples of where storyboarding may be needed,&nbsp;for
    example,&nbsp;Capability Discovery, Use-case Development, User Interfacing, Requirements Clarifying, Prototyping.<br />
    <br />
    Inception Phase Example: Capability Requirements Discovery<br />
    Elaboration Phase Example: Prototyping Requirements Clarification<br />
    <br />
    <em>4. Identify Development Lifecycle Phase</em><br />
    Clearly there is a relationship between the type of storyboard to be used and the phase of the development lifecycle.
    It is likely that during the Inception Phase that requirements are being 'discovered', while in the Elaboration Phase
    there may need to be a further understanding and clarification of the requirements.<br />
    <br />
    <em>5. Determine Level of Fidelity to be Used</em><br />
    When planning to use storyboarding, the level of fidelity (that is,&nbsp;how accurately must the storyboard reflect the
    theme under investigation) should be determined. It is likely that a low level of fidelity could be used when
    storyboarding during the Inception Phase, as it is unlikely to be clear what the 'end' product will be. When using
    storyboarding during the Elaboration Phase, it is likely that there will be considerable knowledge of what the end
    product will be and will appear like. The higher level of fidelity will be important to accurate reflect this
    appearance to enable the clarification of requirements to take place.<br />
    <br />
    <em>6. Identify Stakeholder Role<br />
    </em>The role of the stakeholder to be questioned during storyboarding should be identified, particularly when there
    will be multiple storyboards.<br />
    <br />
    Inception Phase Example: Retail shopper<br />
    Elaboration Phase Example: Music enthusiast<br />
    <br />
    <em>7. Identify Constraints</em><br />
    Before the storyboard begins, it is essential that any constraints applicable for the storyboard are identified. This
    will ensure that the development remains within any limiting circumstances such as legal constraints or domain
    standards.<br />
    <br />
    Inception Phase Example: An audit trail of the order/purchase process must be available for scrutinizers<br />
    Elaboration Phase Example: The GUI should conform to Standard Windows conventions<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Post Conditions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Following the completion of the storyboard it is essential that the validity of the developed storyboard is confirmed
    and any further follow-on work is identified.<br />
    <br />
    <em>1. Confirm original problem resolved</em><br />
    Has the storyboard fully resolved the original problem identified?<br />
    Yes/Partial/No<br />
    <br />
    <em>2. Confirm purpose of storyboard satisfied</em><br />
    Was the purpose of conducting the storyboard satisfied?<br />
    Yes/No<br />
    <br />
    <em>3. Storyboard agreed with Stakeholder<br />
    </em>Has the stakeholder involved with the storyboard taken ownership for the storyboard yet?<br />
    Yes/Under review/No<br />
    <br />
    <em>4. Further storyboard themes identified</em><br />
    During the development of the storyboard were other storyboard themes identified. What were those themes and what
    stakeholder roles would be involved?<br />
    <br />
    Inception Phase Example: How the retailers may keep track of deliveries<br />
    Elaboration Phase Example: The location, appearance, and occurrence of the album art feature<br />
    <br />
    <em>5. Related storyboards</em><br />
    Identifying where other storyboards have been or are planned to be developed. Typical where a sequence of actions, each
    fully discovered via separate storyboards.<br />
    <br />
    <em>6. Assumptions made</em><br />
    Identifying any assumptions that were made during the storyboard development. These assumptions will require follow-up
    action to confirm if correct<br />
    <br />
    Example: only valid with UK legal jurisdiction<br />
    <br />
    <em>7. New Constraints</em><br />
    Identifying any constraints discovered during the storyboard development and not already defined in the
    pre-conditions<br />
    <br />
    <em>8. Requirements sources identified within the storyboard<br />
    </em>

    <strong>What is storyboarding</strong>
</p>
<p>
    "Picture the scene..."<br />
    <br />
    How often do we start a tale of fame and fortune, comedy or tragedy with this phrase? What follows is some description
    that relates the story we want to tell. In software development, you have a story to tell too. You are building or
    modifying software systems, in ways that are yet to be decided, or yet to be understood.<br />
    <br />
    "Actually, I can't picture the scene..."<br />
    <br />
    Most of the time you don't have that story firmly embedded in our mind. You don't understand the story, the background,
    what happened before and what happens next. Even if you understand exactly what you are trying to do, no-one else has
    exactly the same picture. Storyboarding is a technique used to capture and explain the story to those around you -
    translating the ideas you might have in your head into something concrete that everyone can understand.<br />
    <br />
    Storyboarding is not new. We have recently borrowed the concepts and techniques from the film industry as this is the
    best-known examples of the use of storyboards. From a software development perspective, a storyboard is defined as
    "...a logical and conceptual description of system functionality for a specific scenario, including the interaction
    required between the system users and the system. A Storyboard "tells a specific story"" [RUP, 2008]<br />
    <br />
    This definition covers the use of storyboards as a way of capturing the way a solution behaves, as though you have
    already solved the problem. A storyboard is also a way to explore the context of a system, and explore possible options
    to solve the problem a system is designed to solve.<br />
    <br />
    The task of building up storyboards is called storyboarding. "Storyboarding is a technique for capturing logical and
    conceptual description of system functionality for a specific scenario". [RUP, 2008]<br />
    <br />
    A storyboard typically shows the user interface drawn to show how the system will operate for a particular purpose.
    Usually, a storyboard is a sequence of frames, where each frame has a description of the actions that lead to the next
    frame. However, we are not trying to design a user interface - we are trying to illustrate the user experience. A film
    storyboard will capture the flow of the scene, camera angles, and the characters, a software storyboard will capture
    the main intent of the software in a particular context.

    <strong>Benefits of storyboarding</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Storyboarding can help us reduce project risks, and save time and money.<br />
    <br />
    Customers don't always know what exactly they want. You will often hear them saying, "I'll know it when I see it."
    Storyboarding can help you resolve requirement uncertainties early in the development process. You can use these
    uncertainties in requirements definition to determine when storyboarding will be useful, and gain agreement on what the
    system should do by visualizing the requirements with storyboards.<br />
    <br />
    Storyboarding helps eliciting, clarifying, completing, and validating requirements. Storyboarding encourages
    stakeholder participation, and allows you to explore technical solution alternatives without coding. You can use
    storyboards for interactive requirements/use case review sessions with stakeholders, and find what's missing, what's
    wrong, what's unnecessary, and what's desired.<br />
    <br />
    Storyboards can also be leveraged by designers, developers, testers, architect, and UI Designers.

<p>
    <strong>What goes in a storyboard</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Persona</em><br />
    A persona describes a fictive person, who is a user of a system. It represents the archetype of a user based on the
    knowledge of real users. The goal is to bring the users to life by developing personas with real names, personalities,
    motivations, and etc. You typically create several personas for a system. A persona is an instance of actor, and it can
    be associated with multiple storyboards.<br />
    <br />
    The purposes of describing a persona are:<br />
    • to ensure that you explore all the needs of your user base<br />
    • to act as "user stand-ins", helping to guide your decisions about functionality and design<br />
    • to keep your storyboard focused on a very specific user context and user goal<br />
    <br />
    <em>Usage scenario</em><br />
    A usage scenario describes how a persona interact with a system to perform a specific task. It is driven by the user
    needs and motivation of doing the task. It can be a summary of what the persona does in a storyboard before you create
    it. If you do use-case driven development, a usage scenario is typically an instance of a complete use case scenario,
    or a portion of the use case scenario.<br />
    <br />
    <em>Storyboard</em><br />
    A storyboard is a frame-by-frame depiction of a usage scenario, where each frame has a description of the actions that
    lead to the next frame. It contains an in-depth walkthrough of a linear story represented as graphical frames on a
    timeline with sample "data".<br />

<p>Project teams following the AUP deliver incremental releases over time.&nbsp; 
In other words, instead of the &quot;big bang&quot; approach where you deliver software 
all at once you instead release it into production in portions (e.g. version 1, 
then version 2, and so on).</p>
<p>AUP teams typically deliver development releases at the end of each iteration 
into
	<a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/sandboxes.html">pre-production 
testing and/or demo 
	staging area(s)</a> (see <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a>).&nbsp; A 
development release of an application is something that could potentially be 
released into production if it were to be put through your pre-production 
quality assurance (QA), testing, and deployment processes.&nbsp; Granted, this 
won&#8217;t be true earliest development releases because you won&#8217;t have delivered 
sufficient functionality to make deployment worth your while.&nbsp; Furthermore 
at the beginning of a project you often stub out interfaces to shared services &#8211; 
such as security, persistence, or even reusable legacy functionality &#8211; so 
technically you still have some clean up to do before you&#8217;re ready to release to 
production.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a name="Figure1">Figure 1</a>. Sandboxes.</b></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="../images/sandboxes.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good process pattern to adopt is that if you have a new version of working 
software then you should consider&nbsp;deploying it at least into the 
pre-production/demo environments to share it with others.&nbsp; The sooner it 
gets into the hands of people outside of your team, the sooner you will start to 
get feedback from others. </p>
<p>In <a href="#Figure2">Figure 2</a> you see that the 
	first production release often takes longer to deliver than subsequent 
	releases; in the first release of a system you likely need to get a lot of 
	the &#8220;plumbing&#8221; in place and your team likely hasn&#8217;t &#8220;gelled&#8221; yet enabling 
	them to become efficient at collaboration.&nbsp; The first production release may 
	take you twelve months to deliver, the second release nine months, and then 
	other releases are delivered every six months.&nbsp; An early focus on 
	deployment issues not only enables you to avoid problems it also allows you 
	to take advantage of your experiences during development.&nbsp; For example, when 
	you are deploying software into your staging area you should take notes of 
	what works and what doesn&#8217;t, notes that can serve as the backbone of your 
	installation scripts.</p>

<a href="#Figure3">Figure 3</a> depicts how you will need to 
schedule the deployment of your application into pre-defined deployment windows, 
shown in green.&nbsp; A deployment window, often called a release window, is a 
specific point in time where it is permissible to deploy a system into 
production.&nbsp; Your 
<a href="http://www.enterpriseunifiedprocess.com/essays/operationsAndSupport.html">operations staff</a> will very likely have strict rules regarding 
when application teams may deploy systems.&nbsp; <a href="#Figure3">
Figure 3</a> shows how two project teams schedule the deployment of their 
changes (including database refactorings) into available deployment windows.&nbsp; 
Sometimes there is nothing to deploy, sometimes one team has changes, and other 
times both teams have schema changes to deploy. You will naturally need to 
coordinate with any other teams which are deploying during the same deployment 
window.&nbsp; This coordination will occur long before you go to deploy, and 
frankly the primary reason why your pre-production test environment exists is to 
provide a sandbox in which you can resolve multi-system issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;

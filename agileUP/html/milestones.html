<p>As you can see in <a href="#Figure1">Figure 1</a>, there are four milestones in the AUP.&nbsp; At 
each of these milestones, which signal the end of the phase, you should consider 
having a &quot;milestone review&quot; which verifies that your team has successfully 
fulfilled the milestone criteria.&nbsp; The four milestones are:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="#LCO">Lifecycle Objectives (LCO)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#LCA">Lifecycle Architecture (LCA)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#IOC">Initial Operating Capacity (IOC)</a></li>
	<li><a href="#PR">Product Release (PR)</a></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="LCO" href="inception.html">Inception Phase Milestone: Lifecycle Objectives (LCO)</a></h3>
<p>At this milestone, the stakeholders assess the state of the project. They 
must agree on the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Scope concurrence</b>.&nbsp; The stakeholders reach agreement as to the 
  scope of the project.</li>
  <li><b>Initial requirements definition</b>. There is agreement that the right 
  set of requirements have been captured, at a high level, and 
  there is a shared understanding of those requirements.</li>
  <li><b>Plan concurrence</b>.&nbsp; The stakeholders agree with the initial cost and 
  schedule estimates.</li>
  <li><b>Risk acceptance</b>.&nbsp; The risks have been identified, assessed, and 
  acceptable strategies to address them have been identified.</li>
  <li><b>Process acceptance</b>.&nbsp; The <a href="deliverables.html#AUP">AUP</a> has been initially 
  tailored and agreed to by all parties.</li>
  <li><b>Feasibility</b>.&nbsp; The project makes 
  sense from business, technical, and operational perspectives.</li>
  <li><b>Project plan</b>.&nbsp; Adequate plans are in place for the next phase 
  (<a href="elaboration.html">Elaboration</a>).</li>
  <li><b>Portfolio compliance</b>.&nbsp; Does the scope of the project fit well 
  into your organization's overall project portfolio?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="LCA" href="elaboration.html">Elaboration Phase Milestone: Lifecycle Architecture (LCA)</a></h3>
<p>At this milestone, the stakeholders assess the state of the project. They 
must agree on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Vision stability</b>. The project vision has stabilized and is 
  realistic.</li>
  <li><b>Architecture stability</b>.&nbsp; You agree that the architecture is stable 
  and sufficient to satisfy the requirements. The architecture has been 
  prototyped where appropriate to address major architectural risks.</li>
  <li><b>Risk acceptance</b>.&nbsp; The risks have been assessed to ensure they have 
  been properly understood and documented and strategies to handle them are 
  acceptable.</li>
  <li><b>Feasibility</b>.&nbsp; The project still makes 
  sense from business, technical, and operational perspectives.</li>
  <li><b>Project plan</b>. Detailed iteration plans for the next few 
  <a href="construction.html">Construction</a> iterations, as well as a high-level project plan, are in place.</li>
  <li><b>Enterprise compliance</b>.&nbsp; Does the system architecture reflect 
  the realities of the enterprise architecture?</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="IOC" href="construction.html">Construction Phase Milestone: Initial Operational Capability (IOC)</a></h3>
<p>At this milestone, the stakeholders must agree on the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>System stability</b>. The software and supporting documentation are 
  acceptable (stable and mature) to deploy the system to users.</li>
  <li><b>Prepared stakeholders</b>. The stakeholders (and the business) are 
  ready for the system to be deployed (although may still need training).</li>
  <li><b>Risk acceptance</b>.&nbsp; The risks have been assessed to ensure they have 
  been properly understood and documented and strategies to handle them are 
  acceptable.</li>
  <li><b>Cost and estimate acceptance</b>. The current expenditures are 
  acceptable and reasonable estimates have been made for future costs and 
  schedules.</li>
  <li><b>Project plan</b>. Detailed iteration plans for the next few 
	<a href="transition.html">Transition</a> 
  iterations, as well as a high-level project plan, are in place.</li>
  <li><b>Enterprise compliance</b>.&nbsp; Do the work products produced by 
  the team comply to the appropriate enterprise standards?&nbsp; </li>

    Implementing a measurement process is similar to implementing any new initiative. Measurement may represent a
    significant change in how an organization does business. The issues and concerns related to this change must be
    addressed directly. Three key steps that must be performed to effectively introduce measurement into an oraganization
    are
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Obtain Organizational Commitment
    </li>
    <li>
        Define Responsibilities
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide Resources
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A fourth step, Review Progress of Measurement Program, ensures that measurement is sustained. These tasks can be
    accomplished sequentially or in parallel. Once these tasks are in place, the measurement process is initiated.<br />

<td><p>
    The objective of this step is to develop support for measurement at all levels within the organization. Measurement
    programs mandated by management will seldom succeed without buy-in and support from project technical and managment
    staff members. Staff members at all levels need to understand how measurement will directly benefit their projects and
    their own work processes.
</p>
<p>
    Implementing measurement often requires a significant cultural change within an organization. Just as with any other
    change, uncertainties associated with the introduction of measurement may cause anxiety. Concerns about change can be
    overcome by communicating to the staff a clear understanding of the measurement process and how the measurement results
    will be used at all levels within the organization. Some people may fear that measurement results will be used
    improperly to evaluate individual performance. Measurement is most effective within a culture that encourages people to
    articulate problems and risks. This can be a major shift for many organizations.
</p>
<p>
    Successful measurement programs must be adopted by both management and the technical staff. Management support,
    involvement, and leadership are critical to successfully implement a measurement process. Support goes beyond the
    senior managers' stating that measurement is "a good idea". Support involves establishing measurement policies,
    providing adequate resources, creating a focus on measurement by communicating objectives, and defininig critical
    success factors. It also includes reviewing the measurement data and analyses through routine feedback loops and then
    acting on the recommendations from these analyses.

</div>
<div class="stepHeading">Define Measurement Responsibilities</div>
<div class="stepContent">
<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    The size and structure of each organization determine how measurement responsibilities are assigned. The number of
    people involved and the allocation of measurement tasks vary considerably from organization to organization, depending
    on the size and scope of the project. The measurement team may consist of a part-time measurement analyst or a team of
    people. A group of people may be organized as the measurement steering committee. The primary responsibility for the
    measurement process is at the management level, represented by either the executive manager or the project manager.
</p>
<p>
    The executive manager could be the CEO, CIO, business sector maanger, risk manager, or other upper-level manager who
    generally has responsibility for an organization that controls more than one project. The executive manager's decisions
    materially affect all of the projects within the organization. Measurement helps the executive manager determine the
    status of the individual projects and make decisions that apply across the organization.
</p>
<p>
    The project manager has direct responsibility for the sucess of a software-intensive system. In most cases, the project
    manager is the primary user of the measurement results. This person is responsible for identifying and managing the
    software information needs and communicating with the senior levels of executive management. The project manager users
    measurement to make project decisions.
</p>
<p>
    It is the project manager's responsibility to ensure that measurement is integrated into the project. Integration
    includes all of the supporting activities that make the measurement process a part of the overall project management
    and technical processes.
</p>
<p>
    While management is responsible for integrating and using measurement within the organization, the project technical
    staff is usually assigned the day-to-day tasks related to planning and performing measurement. Generally an individual
    or team has the primary responsibility for planning measurement, collecting and processing the measurement data,
    analyzing the measurement results, and reporting the results to management.
</p>
<p>
    To coordinate measurement activities, organizations often establish a measurement steering committee with
    representation from many projects and from support staff functions. These people could include project managers,
    programmers, testers, or accounting department personnel. The steering committee usually takes responsibility for the
    policies, procedures, and common measurement definitions. It often operates like a configuration control board, by
    applying internal procedures to ensure that changes to the measurement plan are evaluated and properly implemented.
    Some organizations may be too small to support a measurement steering committee, and in those cases, the project
    managers usually have to maintain their own plans and data sets.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the size and scope of the project, the measurement team can consist of a part-time measurement analyst or
    a multi-person team. In either case, the primary meeasurement responsibility for the project must be assigned to a
    specific individual, and that individual must interface directly with the project development organization. Above all,
    the personnel responsible for measurement must be able to independently arrive at objective answers and alternatives
    and be able to provide results directly to the project decision makers.
</p>
<p>
    Other members of the project technical staff also have responsiblity within the measurement process. Each should
    understand how the process works and what information it can provide to them. They should also support measurement
    analysis efforts by helping to identify project events that may have an impact on interpreting the measurement data.
</p>
<p>
    The measurement results are most effective when used by the software development team on a day-to-day basis. In
    addition to helping to communicate issues and solutions, the development team uses the measurement results to identify
    and correct problems quickly as part of its regular work.

<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

    Experience indicates that a measurement program requires 1 to 5 percent of the project budget. The actual cost of a
    specific measurement program is determined by the scope of data collected and the ability of planners to integrate data
    collection and analysis into existing management and technical processes.
</p>
<p>
    As with any initiative, there are some start-up costs associated with implementing a measurement program. The cost of
    measurement for individual projects will diminish as measurement becomes an established activity within the
    organization. Within a relatively short period of time after it is established, measurement should become
    self-supporting, saving at least as much as it costs.
</p>
<p>
    Measurement costs include labor, training, and tools to generate, process, analyze, and report data. Project teams with
    mature engineering processes use measurement data internally to manage their projects. Subsequently, there should be
    little additional cost to collect and report this data at the organizational level. If a project team is not using
    measurement, their life-cycle process may not be very mature.
</p>
<h4>
    Measurement Training
</h4>
<p>
    Personnel at all levels of the organization require measurement training that directly addresses the skills required
    for their roles.
</p>
<p>
    Executive and project managers may require training in the relationship of the measurement program to the
    organization's engineering processes and prducts. These managers must understand the capabilities and limitations of
    the measurement process to provide information that can be used for decision making.
</p>
<p>
    Project managers must understand the measurement results presented to them. They must understand how to interpret the
    results and take effective actions. They also need confidence in the data collection process.
</p>
<p>
    Analysts need training or experience in basic measurement skills. Additional training may be required for more advanced
    analysis, such as estimation, modeling, and statistical analysis.
</p>
<p>
    Project team members must be trained as data providers. They cannot perform their roles in the measurement process if
    they do not understand the data collection requirements and reporting formats.
</p>
<h3>
    Measurement Tools
</h3>
<p>
    Once the specific measurement requirements and procedures have been defined, the tools to collect, process, and analyze
    the data must be identified. On small projects, the measurement process can be supported on a personal computer with
    off-the-shelf office software. On larger projects, or those that require more advanced analysis techniques, additional
    measurement tools are usually required. Specific tools should not be purchased before determining if they actually
    support the information needs of a project. The project information needs and the measurement process drive the tool
    requirements, not the other way around. An exsisting set of measurement tools should not be used to define a
    measurement process.
</p>
<p>
    Several classes of tools are commonly applied to the measurement process, as described in the following table.<br />

Some general guidelines for selecting measurement support tools are as follows:<br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        Select tools that can be customized to meet specific project needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Evalute tools that are already available within the organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        When selecting engineering tools, consider their ability to provide technical and management process data about the
        tasks and products they support.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not tailor a measurement program based solely on data from existing tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select tools that automate the mechanics of data-handling efforts such as collecting, processing, analyzing,
        exporting/importing, and reporting.
    </li>
    <li>
        Select tools that run on a common platform.<br />

    The point at which a project initiates the measurement process depends on the specific situation. The first three tasks
    in the Establish and Sustain Measurement Commitment task may be conducted in parallel on a project. Once key prsonnel
    and resources have been allocated on a project, the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/psm_plan_measurement_88944F07.html" guid="_QO0mYXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Task: Plan Measurement (PSM)</a>&nbsp;may be initiated, even if some personnel have not been trained or some resources are
    not yet available.&nbsp; Once the task is initiated, the results need to be reviewed to ensure that information
    provided to the decision makers is what they need to make the best decision possible.
</p>
<p>
    A project may also adopt an incremental approach to implementaiton by working with a small set of information needs and
    measures&nbsp;initially, then extending the scope of the measurement program as the organization becomes fully capable.
    Data collection and analysis should be started on a small scale early to demonstrate the value of the measuremen
    tprocess. Implementing even a few key mesaures to address the highest-priority information needs provides important new
    information. Reviews in this environment should be held just prior to the implementation of the new measures. This is
    to ensure that the existing measures are still applicable and the the new measures and processes do not conflict with
    the existing measures and processes.
</p>
<p>
    During the initial implementation, it is especially important to focus on getting good data and to ensure that the
    measurement results are not used to evaluate individuals or compare projects. Results should be discussed with the data
    providers before reporting them to management. Discussions should focus on obtaining insight and should relate results
    to project activities. Measurement results and reviews should be shared with all stakeholders, including organizational
    managers, project managers, and the engineering staff.

<div class="stepContent">
<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    The following are some tips for implementing a successful measurement program.
</p>
<h3>
    Start Small
</h3>
<p>
    A common mistake in measurement implementation is to try to do too much too quickly. Successful measurement programs
    begin with only a few measures that address key information needs. A comprehensive measurement program is built over
    time and continues to evolve.
</p>
<h3>
    Provide Adequate Training
</h3>
<p>
    All users at all levels must understand what the measurement data represents. This understanding is vital to the proper
    interpretation of the measurement analysis results. Everyone in the organization needs to understand both the
    capabilities and the limitations of the measurement process.
</p>
<h3>
    Demonstrate Commitment
</h3>
<p>
    Acceptance begins with a demonstration of management commitment. Orientation or training helps to ensure that all
    participants understand their responsibilities in the measuremen tprocess and the benefits they can obtain. However,
    commitment and acceptance must be sustained over time. Measurement results should be made visible; how the results
    support both project- and higher-level management objectives should be shown.
</p>
<h3>
    Minimize Costs
</h3>
<p>
    The measurement process must be cost-effective to succeed. Measures and reports should address key project information
    needs. Data should not be collected or reports distributed that are not needed or are not used.
</p>
<p>
    Data collection and reporting should be automated whenever possible. Data collection should be an automatic by-product
    of normal activity. An example of this would be the automatic transfers from other systems such as finance and payroll
    into a project status report. The measurement process may start with basic, commerically available applications:
    database, spreadsheet, word processing, and presentation graphics. MOre advanced tools can be added later.
</p>
<h3>
    Adopt an Action Orientation
</h3>
<p>
    Measures that help address management information needs early in a project should be selected. Information must be
    obtained early enough to allow managers to take the actions necessary to reduce risks or correct problems.
</p>
<p>
    Management decisions should not wait until the measurement process provides a complete set of perfect data. Management
    information should be derived from a minmal amount of data. complemented by real-time events and qualitative insight,
    so that managers can make informed decisions quickly.
</p>
<p>
    Measurement data and information should be available to everyone in the organization. Participants need training,
    tools, and access to the basic data to help them derive the information they need to support their work.
</p>
<p>
    Standard indicators and report formats can be developed that are tied directly to critical objectives and information
    needs and easy to read and understand. Standard indicators and reports will foster a common language for communicating
    status and pointing out anomalies. Managers must be willing to listen to "bad news" reported by the measurement process
    and to react in a constructive manner.
</p>
<p>
    Use of measurement data should be proactive in order to assess the feasiblity of a management action. In many cases,
    historical data and current project data will indicate that an action is not feasible.
</p>
<p>
    Measurement data and indicators can be used to report project status. Measurement results should not be influenced or
    skewed. The decision maker should understand how results were derived, what they mean for project issues, and what
    actions are feasible.
</p>
<p>
    Measurement should be an integral part of the project and the organization; it should support the existing technical
    and management processes. Measurement should not be treated as an "add-on" but as a part the organization's normal
    business and decision-making process.
</p>
<h3>
    Communicate
</h3>
<p>
    A key to success in a development is to establish an effective interface among the various projects, work groups, and
    individuals. Different managers and companies offer different perspectivites on project performance. Good communication
    improves understanding on all sides and leads to a win-win situation.
</p>
<p>
    Communication within the company is essential, and timeliness is critical. If a negative trend is noted and not
    communicated for one or two months, it could lead to a problem not only for the project but also potentially for the
    entire company. Measurement provides a basis for effective communication within a company, as well as between different
    organizations.<br />

<p>
    This task involves collecting data from the various sources identified in the measurement plan, preparing it for
    analysis, and then storing it where it will be accessible for analysis. The three basic issues that must be addressed
    in this task are: 1) how to make the data visible and to capture it properly, 2) how to ensure the quality of the data,
    and 3) how to store and manage the data for analysis. The answers to these questions should be developed and documented
    during the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/psm_plan_measurement_88944F07.html" guid="_QO0mYXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Plan Measurement (PSM)</a> activity. This section discusses some of the
    practical issues related to data collection that may not be obvious during the planning process.
</p>
<p>
    How data is actually captured during project activities affects the cost and accuracy of this task. In many cases data
    can be captured <i>automatically</i>. In an example of automatic data collection, code analysis tools are used to
    analyze source code and automatically generate measures of the code's size in lines of code, code complexity, and other
    code characteristics. In other cases data may be captured through <i>manual</i> processes. For example, testers may
    generate individual defect reports during the testing process as they identify each problem. How data is stored once it
    is generated and captured is also important. Data stored in an accessible electronic format is most desirable. For
    example, some code analysis tools may store their results in a database or spreadsheet-compatible file. Other tools may
    be limited and only report results via a printed report or via an on-screen display. In the case of defect data,
    testers may have the ability to enter defect reports directly into a defect tracking system or may be required to
    complete a paper form.
</p>
<p>
    Plan or "baseline" measures are usually generated at different points in time than actual performance data. Since these
    two types of data are often combined to analyze project performance, how and where plan data is stored also influences
    this task. Plan data is often generated at the beginning of a project and may be revised periodically. Plan data may be
    stored in project plans created using a word processing tool, project planning tool, or spreadsheet. Other plan data
    (e.g., thresholds, norms, and control limits generated from past projects' actual performance data) may have actually
    been generated outside the project process and stored in an organizational database. In contrast, actual performance
    data is generated and accumulates gradually over time, and may be stored in different systems (e.g., time reporting
    systems, spreadsheets, defect tracking systems, etc.) to accommodate continuous data generation, collection, and
    storage.
</p>
<p>
    Continuing with the coding progress example, the following figure shows how plan and actual data were stored in
    different locations on a project. Also shown is how the measurement constructs specified in the measurement plan
    provide a roadmap for pulling the data together for analysis. The measurement method for each base measure and the
    measurement procedure provide the "how to" details including how data will be captured and how and where it will be
    stored. In this case, the measurement methods for both planned and actual base measures describe how data is aggregated
    by week and accumulated over time. A derived measure is produced from the plan and actual base measures to provide an
    indication of the percent of variance that exists each week between the plan and actual performance. These measures are
    then combined into an indicator, in this case a line graph and variance table, that the project manager and development
    team can review and use as the basis of their discussion of coding status and progress.
</p>

    <p align="center">
        <img height="687" alt="" src="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/resources/4.2.jpg" width="620" border="0" />
    </p>
    <p class="picturetext">
        Combining Multiple Sources of Data
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    As this example shows, base measures often require additional "processing" prior to, or as part of, the analysis. This
    may involve aggregating the data, normalizing the data, or deriving additional measures by applying a mathematical
    formula or measurement function to the data.
</p>
<p>
    The reliability of a flexible analysis process depends on effective data management. As with any other important
    project asset, values of base measures and indicators should be managed and controlled. (Values of derived measures can
    be computed from values of base measures). Configuration management concepts, such as controlled write access and using
    version numbers for electronic files and data sets, should be applied to maintain the integrity of the data. Keeping
    data synchronized is also important when data must be extracted from its original source and stored elsewhere to
    facilitate analysis. All data should be identified by its collection date and source; this will help the <a class="PresentationName" guid="_QO0mPnHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Measurement Analyst</a> role align findings and
    conclusions with project events and to allow comparison of data over time and from different sources.
</p>
<p>
    Well-defined measurement constructs and processes improve data quality and, ultimately, the value of performing
    measurement on a project. Even seemingly obvious terms must be defined. For example, a "lines of code" base measure may
    be interpreted to mean all physical lines, only non-comment lines, executable statements, etc. Even the specification
    for a unit of measure can be ambiguous; for example, a "staff month" varies from organization to organization. Even if
    specifications are precise and well understood by the process owners, many data problems still arise whenever data is
    being generated, captured, stored, and processed. Typical problems include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Data Not Captured:</b> When the generation of data depends on a manual activity, what happens when the activity
        is bypassed?
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Wrong Values Captured:</b> Even when base measures are clearly specified and people are trained in how to record
        data, deficient information is still entered.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Measurement System Errors:</b> Most measurement “systems” are comprised of off-the-shelf tools and homegrown
        spreadsheets and databases that can lead to data collection and processing errors.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Data should be verified before it is used for analysis. Data verification should consider both the accuracy of the data
    as it is recorded, and the fidelity with which it is processed. An examination of data stores can often uncover
    problems. Data verification requires accurate measurement specifications and an understanding of the project's defined
    process. Checklists can provide a useful tool for data verification.
</p>
<p>
    Any data concerns or inconsistencies should be resolved through communication with the data providers on the project
    team. Missing data, significant changes in values, or changes in the data structure should always be discussed with the
    project team. Even accurate and verified engineering data may be "noisy"; Software development is a human-intensive
    activity; things seldom go exactly as planned. Because performance varies from week to week, it is rare that "actual"
    results exactly match the plan.

<p>
    The principal task of the Perform Measurement activity is to analyze data. This is where much of the project's
    measurement effort will be focused. This task transforms values of base measures to produce values for indicators, the
    basic building blocks of analysis. Indicators and associated decision criteria are used to make planning decisions or
    determine the need for corrective action once the project has started. These analyses are performed by executing the
    data analysis procedures defined in the measurement plan. However, since all information needs and management questions
    cannot be anticipated during planning, the data analysis procedure must also provide for an ad-hoc analysis component.
</p>
<p>
    The following shows the three types of analysis typically employed to support project management decisions. Each type
    of analysis relies on unique measurement techniques, has its own inputs, and produces different types of results. The
    focus of analysis always changes over the course of a project, and for most projects, all three types usually must be
    addressed
</p>

    </p>
    <p class="picturetext">
        Three Types of Analysis
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Early in the software project, and when plans are updated, the focus is on <i>estimation</i> to support project
    planning. Estimation establishes target values for work product size, project effort, project schedules, and other key
    objectives. Estimation usually starts with historical data and assumptions about the project's process and products.
    Estimation also identifies uncertainties that feed back into the issue identification activity. Estimation should be
    conducted during the initial project-planning phase and whenever replans are undertaken.
</p>
<p>
    As project planning nears completion, the focus shifts to <i>feasibility analysis</i>. This type of analysis determines
    whether project plans and targets are realistic and achievable. Feasibility analysis uses historical data, experience,
    and consistency checks to evaluate the project plans. It also helps to define the interdependencies between the key
    planning parameters related to product capability, cost, and schedule. Risks identified during this stage should be
    incorporated into the project's risk management process. Feasibility analysis should also be conducted during the
    initial project-planning phase and during all subsequent replans.
</p>
<p>
    Once the project has begun, <i>performance analysis</i> determines whether the project is meeting defined plans,
    assumptions, and targets. Inputs include plan and actual performance data. Performance analysis is designed to identify
    risks, problems, and corrective actions. Performance analysis should be conducted on a regular basis throughout the
    project's life cycle.

    The <a class="elementLink" href="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/psm_perform_measurement_164F97B2.html" guid="_QO0mNXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Perform Measurement (PSM)</a> activity provides more guidance on the
    specific measurement techniques used in these three different types of analysis.
</p>
<h4>
    Indicator Generation
</h4>
<p>
    Indicators are combinations of base and/or derived measures and predefined decision or evaluation criteria. The <a class="elementLink" href="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/psm_plan_measurement_88944F07.html" guid="_QO0mYXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Plan Measurement (PSM)</a> activity explained that an initial set of
    indicators is designed during the measurement planning activity to support identified information needs. This section
    examines the details of indicator generation as part of the analysis process.
</p>
<p>
    Few information needs can be addressed by collecting only "current" or actual performance data. Actual data must be
    compared with an <i>expectation</i> of what it should be. That expectation may be expressed in "planned" values,
    historical averages, derived limits, or thresholds. These "expected" values usually become one of the base measures in
    an indicator. In addition, predefined decision criteria is used to decide whether or not the difference between actual
    data and expected data is significant.
</p>
<p>
    The following figure provides an example of the indicator of coding progress.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="center">
        <img height="477" alt="" src="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/resources/4.5.jpg" width="658" border="0" />
    </p>
    <p class="picturetext">
        Indicator Example
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    On most projects, information needs evolve rapidly. While the measurement plan may contain a set of predefined
    indicators designed to provide insight into known information needs, the project's measurement process should allow for
    the dynamic generation of indicators to help investigate problems as they arise. Because base and derived measures can
    be combined in many different ways, various indicators can be constructed from the same set of measures. This allows
    tremendous flexibility in addressing information needs and analyzing issues and in adapting to changing information
    requirements. A measurement process that is based only on the periodic delivery of a static set of indicators does not
    have the flexibility to address changing project information needs.
</p>
<p>
    Indicators are often best displayed graphically rather than as a table of numbers. Graphs make trends in data,
    variances, and relationships more obvious and easier to interpret. Many simple charting techniques can be used to
    produce graphical representations of measurement data. The ability to extract the pertinent information contained in
    the measurement data can be improved with proper selection and use of these charting techniques.
</p>
<p>
    Well-designed graphs facilitate communication of measurement results. Graphs should not be complex. They should convey
    a clear message. It is better to have multiple graphs, rather than having numerous messages on one graph.
</p>
<h4>
    The Integrated Analysis Model
</h4>
<p>
    So far in this activity, the focus has been on the generation of a single indicator to provide insight into a project
    information need. It is important to note that the information categories common to software projects are not
    independent of one another. For example, most project managers know that unplanned staff turnover or personnel
    unavailability will most likely impact schedule and progress. "Scope creep" is known to result in a need for more
    resources and schedule than planned. Problems with product quality can cause cost and schedule overruns when sufficient
    rework effort has not been accounted for in schedules and budgets.
</p>
<p>
    The Integrated Analysis Model in the following figure shows the relationships between information categories. This
    model helps build "early warning" capabilities into the measurement process, and helps to relate project information
    needs and issues in terms of cause and effect.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="center">
        <img height="678" alt="" src="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/resources/4-12.jpg" width="626" border="0" />
    </p>
    <p class="picturetext">
        Integrated Analysis Model
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Each of the arrows in the figure represents a relationship. For example, as Product Size and Stability changes, so do
    project Resources and Cost. Each of the common information categories is related to its neighbor in the integrated
    analysis model. This means that "upstream" issues can serve as "leading" indicators of problems with downstream issues.
    Upstream issues can also be investigated to uncover the <i>root cause</i> of a current problem. For example, if
    schedules are beginning to slip and/or progress is slowing, effort or size might be investigated as the cause of the
    schedule problem. Moreover, proactively monitoring effort and size measures can serve as an "early warning system" for
    schedule issues. Early identification of an unplanned size increase can be used to support management decision-making
    such as adding more people to the project or asking for a schedule extension before the project is in jeopardy of
    missing key dates.
</p>
<p>
    The following example shows the use of the Integrated Analysis Model. Two areas of concern for this particular project
    were the uncertainty of software requirements and ability to meet cost and schedule commitments. This figure shows how
    the estimated size of a pertinent software component has grown since the initial estimate.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="center">
        <img height="431" alt="" src="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/resources/4.14.jpg" width="658" border="0" />
    </p>
    <p class="picturetext">
        Software Size Growth
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The Integrated Analysis Model shows that size growth is a leading indicator of a projected increase in development
    effort (and cost), which, in turn, has the potential to impact project schedules.
</p>
<p>
    The next figure shows the variance to date between planned and actual effort for this project. Although the applied
    effort was originally tracking close to plan, indications of the size growth problem are starting to become visible.
    The planned effort probably has not been revised to reflect the re-estimate of size depicted in the previous figure.
    This is critical, given its downstream impact on cost and schedule.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="center">
        <img height="437" alt="" src="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/resources/4.15.jpg" width="658" border="0" />
    </p>
    <p class="picturetext">
        Software Effort
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The size growth indicator&nbsp; can also be used to help predict the amount of expected additional effort that will be
    required. Using the <b>estimator</b> depicted in following figure, the amount of size growth is used to define a new
    plan for total project effort.
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p align="center">
        <img height="430" alt="" src="./../../enterprise.psm/tasks/resources/4.16.jpg" width="658" border="0" />
    </p>
    <p class="picturetext">
        Software Size Used to Re-estimate Development Effort
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This example shows how the Integrated Analysis Model can be used as a tool for solving problems, projecting or
    predicting outcomes, and formulating recommendations. It also illustrates that the analysis process and the generation
    of indicators are dynamic. Indicators may change and evolve over time to answer different, but related, questions, and
    to provide different views of the measurement results. Each information need may require applying a different set of
    analysis techniques in order to isolate, understand, and facilitate resolution of a problem, or to better understand
    and mitigate a risk. As project problems, risks, and information change, the types of analyses performed and the
    indicators generated must be revised.
</p>
<p>
    The Integrated Analysis Model applies equally to estimation, feasibility analysis, and performance analysis.

    The ultimate purpose of measurement is to help engineers, customers, and managers make more informed decisions. The
    final task in the Perform Measurement activity involves formulating recommendations and communicating those
    recommendations along with the analysis results to the appropriate decision maker. As results are discussed and
    information is communicated to various parties, additional questions may arise. This step and the <a href="#AnalyzeData">Analyze Data</a> step may be executed iteratively until all information needed to make a decision
    has been presented.
</p>
<p>
    The <a class="PresentationName" guid="_QO0mPnHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Measurement Analyst</a> role typically
    generates recommendations and provides them to the project manager. The project manager role is responsible for
    selecting the appropriate course of action and ensuring it is implemented.
</p>
<p>
    The analysis of project issues should result in the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b><i>Overall evaluation of the project</i></b>: Evaluation should include status regarding known project
        information needs and projections of performance through completion.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><i>Identification of specific problems, risks, and lack of information</i></b>: The location, cause, and impact
        of current or potential obstacles to project success should be described, along with any noteworthy outliers or
        trends.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><i>Recommendations</i></b>: These should include alternative actions, with advantages and disadvantages of each,
        to address the underlying risks and problems identified in the analysis.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b><i>Potential new issues:</i></b> The nature of the problem or proposed actions may result in new information
        needs that may affect the focus of the measurement process.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Measurement results should be incorporated into project status reports given to senior managers and customers. Many
    projects are required to present their status at various internal management reviews, and sometimes, to customers at
    periodic milestone reviews. Using the Integrated Analysis Model helps to explain how different factors (e.g., a growth
    in size) contribute to certain project results (e.g., schedule slips). This helps to steer the decision makers towards
    a productive and non-argumentative discussion of alternatives when some corrective action is required.
</p>
<p>
    Action must be taken to realize any benefit from measurement. Well-formulated recommendations facilitate action. These
    actions typically involve making adjustments to project resources to optimize performance within the project's
    established constraints. Others actions may require outside decision makers such as senior management or the customer
    to take action. These may include actions such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Extending the project schedule to maintain quality
    </li>
    <li>
        Adding development resources to stay on schedule
    </li>
    <li>
        Deleting functional capabilities to control costs
    </li>
    <li>
        Changing the development approach or acquisition process to improve performance
    </li>
    <li>
        Reallocating project resources and budgets to support key activities
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Some of these courses of action affect external project commitments and may not be taken unilaterally. Decision makers
    need to know how analysis results and recommendations were derived. All assumptions should be well defined. If they
    are, managers can justify decisions and trace recommendations back to the underlying data.
</p>
<p>
    Measurement is more readily accepted and more effectively utilized when the results are widely available. There are
    many methods for accomplishing this. Project staff meetings provide a common forum for reviewing indicators, drawing
    conclusions, and formulating recommendations. This type of team interaction may uncover events and qualitative
    information that help to explain the data. Web-based systems are another increasingly popular approach to making
    measurement results available. Formal reports and e-mail also may be used.

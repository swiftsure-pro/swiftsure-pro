<p>Since every project is described by a unique set of information needs, processes, 
  and products, the set of measures applied to each project is also unique to 
  some degree.</p>
<p>The steps in the measurement selection task include, mapping the appropriate 
  measurable concepts to each identified information need, identifying candidate 
  measures, and specifying measurement constructs that organize these measures 
  to implement each measurable concept most effectively.</p>
<p>Although project information needs drive the selection of appropriate software 
  measures, the overall characteristics of the project and its development approach 
  also must be considered. The types of analysis and models used also affect measurement 
  choices. For example, most parametric estimation models require a defined set 
  of inputs. Thus, selecting a specific estimation model implies selecting the 
  associated measures. Anticipating the types of analyses and reports that will 
  be needed helps to define the required measures.</p>
<p>Mapping project information needs to information categories and measurable 
  concepts helps to select appropriate measures. Each information category has 
  one or more associated measurable concepts. Each measurable concept can be implemented 
  in many different ways. However, these constructs typically incorporate elements 
  from a specific set of base and derived measures. While this mapping is presented 
  as a hierarchical decomposition, in reality some base and derived measures apply 
  to many different measurable concepts and associated measurement constructs.</p>
<p>The predefined information categories, measurable concepts, and measures provide 
  a starting point for measurement selection and specification. They are intended 
  to be modified and adapted to meet individual project needs.</p>


<h4>Characterizing Project Context
  
</h4>
<p>The definition of a measure does not depend solely on identified information 
  needs.&nbsp; The technical and management processes of the project must also 
  be considered.&nbsp; Project information needs identify the information that 
  the measurement process must derive from the data. The various project management 
  and technical engineering processes determine what specific data may be collected 
  and how the resulting information will be used. Defining an effective measurement 
  program requires an understanding of the context in which measurement occurs.&nbsp; 
  It makes little sense to define measures that cannot be implemented within an 
  existing process.</p>
<p>The suppliers process has a major impact on the cost and effectiveness of 
  the measurement program. Whenever possible, current practices and existing data 
  collection mechanisms should be used, and new measurement requirements should 
  be minimized. The projects Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) can provide the basis 
  for collecting and aggregating data. To the extent that the activities of the 
  development process are well defined, they can be reviewed for useful information. 
  An ad hoc or ill-defined process makes it difficult to tell exactly what is 
  being measured. Consequently, the maturity of a development process (e.g., Capability 
  Maturity Model level) affects the efficiency and accuracy of measurement. Experience 
  has shown that organizations with ad hoc or ill-defined processes are likely 
  to misuse measurement data.</p>
<p>For many information needs, the available data changes across life-cycle activities. 
  For example, during elaboration, progress may be measured in terms of units 
  specified, designed, and built. During construction, progress may be measured 
  in terms of test cases executed and passed.</p>
<p>The results of project characterization are used to identify opportunities 
  for measurement and integration in subsequent measurement tasks. </p>


<h4>Defining the Measurable Concepts
  
</h4>
<p>Once the project information needs are identified, prioritized, and mapped 
  to measurement categories, and the project context has been characterized, the 
  measurement analyst can develop a concept of how to satisfy the information 
  needs. A measurable concept is an idea about how certain activities and products 
  may be related to the information need.&nbsp; A given measurable concept may 
  be implemented in multiple ways. A specific way of implementing a measurable 
  concept is called a measurement construct.&nbsp; Measurement constructs are 
  combinations of base measures, derived measures, and indicators.&nbsp; Measurement 
  constructs for a given measurable concept tend to be developed from the same 
  set of base and derived measures.</p>
<p>In general, at least one measurable concept should be selected for each information 
  need or information category. The following table provides a list of commonly 
  used measurable concepts for each of the information categories.&nbsp; The table 
  also includes an example question that may be addressed by each measurable concept.</p>

</table>
<p>As with information categories, the user can identify additional measurable 
  concepts for information needs that do not map to existing ones. The table above 
  helps in finding the measurable concept or concepts that most closely align 
  with a project information need. For example, if the project information need 
  is the progress of software integration, then Work Unit Progress is an appropriate 
  measurable concept because the information need is related to the progress of 
  a specific activity, namely integration. If the project information need is 
  the amount of additional budget required to fix unanticipated problems, then 
  Financial Performance is pertinent because it addresses&nbsp; the extra cost 
  that will be incurred to correct latent defects.</p>
<p>The measurable concept that provides the best fit for the information need 
  should be selected.&nbsp; For critical or high-priority information needs, more 
  than one measurable concept may be selected.&nbsp; In addition, measurable concepts 
  should be selected to provide leading indicators of issues, before they become 
  more difficult to correct.<U1:P> </U1:P> </p>


<h4>Selecting the Applicable Measures
  
</h4>
<p>The next step in selecting and specifying project measures associated with 
  a measurable concept is to choose the best fit from among the base and derived 
  measures associated with each measurement category.&nbsp; Base measures are 
  the lowest level at which data will be collected. Consider the alignment of 
  potential measures with the information need, as well as the efficiency and 
  effectiveness of the measures themselves and the ability of the project to produce 
  them.&nbsp; For example, if the degree of product volatility<i> </i>is an information 
  need, then requirements and product-oriented size measures may be selected. 
  The appropriate measure depends on the nature of the project. Programming language 
  and application domain influence the choice of a software size measure, such 
  as function points or lines of code. Many different measures may apply to an 
  information need. In most cases, it is not practical to collect all or even 
  most of the potential measures. Generally, more measures should be collected 
  to track high-priority information needs.</p>
<p>In the following table, common information needs are mapped to associated measurable 
  concepts and prospective measures that may be used. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The following measurement selection criteria can help identify the best measures 
  for the project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Measurement effectiveness</b></li>
  <li><b>Domain characteristics</b></li>
  <li><b>Project management practices</b></li>
  <li><b>Cost and availability</b></li>
  <li><b>Life-cycle coverage</b></li>
  <li><b>External requirements</b></li>
  <li><b>Size and origin of system components</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In most cases, the selection process requires tradeoffs among the measurement 
  selection criteria. For example, a given measure may directly address a high-priority 
  project information need, but may be too costly to implement in terms of time 
  and resources. The initial selection of measures will be refined further as 
  the measures are incorporated into measurement constructs.</p>


<h4>Specifying Measurable Constructs
  
</h4>
<p>Once a measurable concept and candidate measures have been selected, base measures, 
  derived measures, and indicators must be defined, as appropriate, to complete 
  the specification of the corresponding measurement construct. This specification 
  provides an operational definition of the relevant measures. The template for 
  the measurement specification artifact provides a sample specification that 
  may be used.</p>
<p>The measurement specifications should be documented for easy 
  reference, usually in the measurement plan. The specifications sometimes vary 
  over the course of the project as processes are modified and updated. Clear 
  and complete specifications and associated definitions help ensure accurate 
  measurement data and meaningful interpretations.&nbsp; Maintaining an experience 
  base of previously developed measurement constructs (stored in the form of completed 
  templates) also facilitates planning. These may be associated with standard 
  organizational processes. Taking advantage of existing measurement specifications 
  and proven data collection mechanisms improves the overall cost-effectiveness 
  of the measurement program within the organization.</p>
<p>The task of specifying a measurement construct usually is performed iteratively.&nbsp; 
  That is, candidate base measures, derived measures, and indicators are sketched 
  out and then adjusted at each level to arrive at a measurement construct that 
  fits the information need.</p>
<p>Many base measures support multiple derived measures and indicators. For example, 
  the <i>Actual Lines Of Code Implemented </i>base measure is used to calculate 
  and analyze software development performance both in terms of <i> Productivity 
  </i>(code/effort - a derived measure), and quality in terms of <i> Defect Density 
  </i>(defects/code - another derived measure).</p>
<p>The initial selection of measures should be reviewed to ensure that all of 
  the high-priority information needs are addressed.</p>
<p>An indicator is a measure or set of measures that provides an estimate or evaluation 
  of specified attributes derived from an analysis model with respect to defined 
  information needs. Combining base and/or derived measures using a predefined 
  algorithm or model generates an indicator. Typically the value of an indicator 
  is a number or series of numbers.&nbsp; An indicator is often represented as 
  a graph or a table. Base and derived measures can be combined for analysis purposes 
  in many different ways, meaning that various indicators can be constructed from 
  the same set of base and derived measures. This allows tremendous flexibility 
  in analyzing issues and in adapting to new information needs as they arise. 
  A measurement process that is based only on the periodic delivery of pre-defined 
  graphs does not have this flexibility.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, measurement procedures usually define a basic set of regularly 
  produced indicators. The analysis activity must be responsive to management 
  questions stimulated by a regular reporting cycle. This means measurement constructs 
  may be redefined or new constructs introduced during analysis. The measurement 
  procedures must allow for that flexibility.</p>
<p>A good indicator will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support analysis of the intended information need</li>
  <li>Support the type of analysis that is needed (estimation, feasibility, or performance 
    analysis)</li>
  <li>Provide the appropriate level of detail</li>
  <li>Indicate a possible management action</li>
  <li>Provide timely information for making decisions and taking action</li>
</ul>
<p>Indicators typically compare actual measured values with an <i>expectation</i> 
  of what they should be. The expectation may be based on historical averages, 
  planning numbers, specific limit values, and threshold ranges. Models and decision 
  criteria help to decide whether or not the difference between actual data and 
  expected data is significant.</p>
<p>The following provides an example of a <i>Coding Progress </i>indicator.&nbsp; </p>

<p class="picturetext">Coding Progress Indicator </p>
<p>Developing and disseminating clear specifications for all measurement constructs 
  facilitates the collection of accurate and consistent data. Even obvious terms, 
  like lines of code or staff months of effort often are defined differently by 
  different organizations. For example, lines of code may be interpreted to mean 
  physical lines, non-comment lines, executable statements, or other variations. 
  Similarly, different organizations may specify a different number of hours of 
  effort per staff month. Carefully completing the template provided above ensures 
  that all the necessary information has been specified.</p>

    Up to this point, measurement planning has focused on what the project manager needs to know.&#160; The next task is to
    examine how the data actually will be collected and analyzed to satisfy the project’s information needs. The
    measurement process should be integrated into the project’s technical and management processes. This includes both
    integrating data collection procedures into processes providing data, and integrating analysis and reporting procedures
    into decision-making processes.&#160; In the final planning task, opportunities for measurement are investigated,
    procedures for collecting and analyzing the data are developed, and the measurement specifications and procedures are
    documented in the measurement plan.
</p>
<h4>
    Identifying Measurement Opportunities
</h4>
<p>
    During measurement planning, identifying and exploiting any measurement mechanisms already in place should be a high
    priority. <i>This is especially important when implementing measurement on an existing project.</i> The use of existing
    data sources offers the advantage of familiarity and potentially lowers the cost of implementing the measurement
    program. A measurement plan can be implemented more quickly when the data providers and decision makers already know
    some elements of the measurement process.
</p>
<p>
    Measurement data potentially comes from many sources. Special attention should be given to existing databases and tools
    that support project management, quality assurance, and configuration management. Extracting and delivering data from
    electronic sources is usually more cost effective than manual collection methods.
</p>
<p>
    Measurement data can typically be described as one of three primary types:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Historical data</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Planning data</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Actual performance data</b>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Measures of components, software units or lines of code, and changes to other deliverables or documentation are usually
    obtained from configuration management records and reports. A source code analyzer may be used for measures of lines of
    code. Product information, such as requirements, components, or number of pages, can also be captured from requirements
    and design tools, and during reviews and inspections. Note that in all these cases, the most efficient method of
    collecting the desired data depends on the nature of the technical and management processes. To the maximum extent
    possible, data collection should be automated so that it is a by-product of normal project activities.
</p>
<p>
    For high priority information needs, sources of data that are available early in the project life cycle should be
    considered. For example, if quality is a major concern, inspection data during design provides earlier sources of data
    than problem report data from tests.
</p>
<p>
    When implementing measurement on existing projects, recognize that information needs may have already been identified
    and some measurement activities may already be implemented. Existing data should be used, if it supports the identified
    information needs.&#160; However, the existing measures often are not fully defined as described in this section.
    Establishing good specifications is just as important for existing data as it is when implementing a new set of
    measures. Without clear definitions, objective communication and meaningful interpretation of the data is impossible.
</p>
<h4>
    Developing Measurement Procedures
</h4>
<p>
    A well thought-out set of measurement constructs, by itself, does not adequately define a measurement program.&#160;
    The physical implementation of a given measurement construct may take many different forms. For example, a base measure
    that quantifies Ada lines of code by counting semicolons could be implemented with one of several commercially
    available source analyzers or even manually. Moreover, unless someone is assigned responsibility for code counting at
    some regular interval, whether by manual or automated means, it isn’t likely to get done. Typically, measurement
    procedures address these assignments and decisions. Procedures should be developed for both the collection and storage
    of data, as well as for its analysis and reporting.
</p>
<p>
    The following considerations must be addressed when developing project measurement procedures:
</p>
<h5>
    Aggregation Structures
</h5>
<p>
    Base measures may be generated from many different entities in the project environment. Many of these entities are
    related to each other. A software product, for example, may be made up of several components (i.e., subroutines or
    classes).&#160; Measuring a component also can provide information about the software product to which it belongs, if
    we understand the relationship. Aggregation structures capture the relationships among the measured entities so that
    data can be combined and decomposed as appropriate to the question being considered.
</p>
<p>
    Three common aggregation structures are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Component Structure</b> - The organization of the software into software products, subsystems, components,
        units, etc. provides a basis for aggregating information about product size, quality, and effort. Thus, the
        high-level software design is one commonly used aggregation structure.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Functional Structure</b> - The decomposition of requirements into functions provides a useful basis for
        aggregating information about functional size and quality.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Activity Structure</b> - The organization of the work processes into process elements and tasks provides a basis
        for aggregating effort and other resource data. Typical activities include requirements analysis, design,
        implementation, integration, and test.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    One common project-planning construct, the Work Breakdown Structure, combines both the component and activity
    structures.
</p>
<p>
    Each entity may be mapped to one or more aggregation structures so that data can be combined appropriately during
    analysis. Alternatively, the position of each measured entity in the structure may be recorded along with the value of
    the measure, for each aggregation structure used.
</p>
<h5>
    Periodicity
</h5>
<p>
    Collection, analysis, and reporting of data need to occur on a frequent enough basis to support the decision-making
    process that generated the information need. These three activities often are scheduled to occur with the same
    frequency (e.g., monthly or weekly). It does not make sense for reporting to occur more often than analysis (since
    there are no new results to report), or for analysis to occur more often than collection (since there is no new data to
    analyze). However, it may be necessary to collect data more frequently than it is analyzed to ensure data quality.
    Human memory and some records may deteriorate or get lost, even over the course of a month. Most project management
    measures are collected and analyzed monthly. However, problem report data may be analyzed weekly during the final
    stages of integration and test. Some data may be collected only occasionally, when an event such as a milestone is
    completed.
</p>
<h5>
    Responsible Individuals
</h5>
<p>
    Many people participate in the measurement process, including those who provide data and perform analysis, as well as
    the decision makers who use measurement results.&#160; Responsibility for each step of the measurement process should
    be assigned to the appropriate individuals.
</p>
<h5>
    Source
</h5>
<p>
    Specify the phase and activity during which each base measure is collected and analyzed. This may be captured in the
    aggregation structure. Some measures apply to multiple phase or activities, but may only be collected from some of
    them.
</p>
<h5>
    Analysis and Reporting Mechanisms
</h5>
<p>
    The tools and procedures for analyzing base and derived measures to produce indicators should be identified. Analysis
    can be as difficult and costly as data collection. Even for data that is readily available, the lack of an appropriate
    analysis tool may make use of the data uneconomical. Anticipate the need the normalize data from different
    organizations and processes.
</p>
<h5>
    Plans and Actuals
</h5>
<p>
    Many analyses involve comparisons of actual performance against plans. Thus, data collection usually begins during the
    project-planning phase. Many measures will include an estimate or plan, and then the actual result. Updates of plans
    and estimates should result in updates to the data.
</p>
<h5>
    Configuration Management
</h5>
<p>
    Ideally, collection, analysis, and reporting follow the measurement plan and stay synchronized. However, data has the
    potential to get lost, mistakes are inevitably made, consequently, it may be necessary to go back to previous versions
    of data and reports. The final and intermediate products of the measurement process should be configuration managed,
    just as the software. At the minimum, the date of collection and analysis needs to be associated with the data and
    reports.
</p>
<h5>
    Documenting the Project Measurement Plan
</h5>
<p>
    The final task of the planning process is documenting the project <a class="elementLink" href="./../../enterprise.psm/workproducts/psm_measurement_plan_66C7D0DB.html" guid="_QNAoUXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Measurement Plan (PSM)</a>. The plan should contain all planning results
    including information needs, measurement specifications, and measurement procedures. The plan should explain how the
    measurement process will be integrated into the project management process so that decision makers can use the
    measurement results.
</p>
<p>
    The project manager is responsible for the project measurement artifact. However, the measurement analyst provides most
    of the information that will be included in this plan.

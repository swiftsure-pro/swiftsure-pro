</h2>
<p>
    Practical Software and Systems Measurement (PSM) is an objective process for analyzing project issues, risks, and
    financial management, focusing on software project management. PSM provides government and industry managers with
    objective information for making sound decisions and for meeting cost, schedule, and technical objectives. It is based
    on actual DoD, government, and industry experience, representing the best practices in the software and engineering
    communities.
</p>
<p>
    <i>Practical Software and Systems Measurement: A Foundation for Objective Project Management</i> was developed to meet
    today's software and system technical and management challenges. It describes an information-driven measurement process
    that will address the unique technical and business goals of your organization. The guidance in PSM represents the best
    practices used by measurement professionals within the software and system acquisition and engineering communities.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Practical Software and Systems Measurement (PSM) is sponsored by the Department of Defense and the US Army. The
        goal of the project is to provide Project Managers with the objective information needed to successfully meet cost,
        schedule, and technical objectives on programs.

        PSM is based on actual measurement experience on DoD, Government and Industry programs. Measurement professionals
        from a wide variety of organizations participate in the project. PSM represents the best measurement practices used
        within the software and system acquisition and engineering communities.

        PSM treats measurement as a flexible process - not a pre-defined list of graphs or reports. The process is adapted
        to address the specific software and system information needs, objectives, and constraints unique to each program.
        The PSM measurement process is defined by a set of nine best practices, called measurement principles.

        PSM integrates the measurement requirements into the software and system supplier's process. The measurement set is
        tailored for each program to ensure that the measurement process is not only cost effective, but also that the
        measures provide meaningful and usable results.

        PSM defines an information-driven analysis approach which helps the Project Manager make informed software and
        system decisions. The PSM analysis approach incorporates the use of multiple measures and non-quantitative program
        data to identify and evaluate information needs, including issues, risks and problems.

        PSM supports current software and system acquisition and measurement policy. PSM defines a non-prescriptive
        measurement approach as required by acquisition reform, and provides a mechanism for the objective communications
        necessary within an Integrated Product Team (IPT).

        PSM provides a basis for enterprise level management. PSM is designed to help put measurement into practice at the
        project level, thereby providing the data required to address enterprise level performance, process improvement,
        and business-related questions. PSM also supports Information Technology (IT) performance measurement requirements.

        PSM is currently being used by DoD, Government, and Industry. PSM has been endorsed by government Acquisition
        Executives, and is a key element of the OUSD (A&T) software initiative. The PSM methodology is also being
        adopted by government and industry organizations.

    <a id="WhatisRUP" name="WhatisRUP">What is RUP?</a>
</h2>
<p>
    The Rational Unified Process&reg; or RUP&reg; product is a software engineering process framework. It provides a disciplined
    approach to assigning tasks and responsibilities within a development organization. Its goal is to ensure the
    production of high-quality software that meets the needs of its end users within a predictable schedule and budget.
</p>
<h2>
    <a id="RelateToRUP" name="RelateToRUP">How do RUP and PSM relate?</a>
</h2>
<p>
    There is much more to implementing a successful measurement program than just the measures themselves. The Practical
    Software and Systems Measurement (PSM) Initiative and the Rational Unified Process&reg; are two existing process frameworks
    that explain the measurement process. The PSM Initiative is a team of government, industry, and academia that was
    formed to bring together and promote the best practices of software and system measurement. The Rational Unified
    Process, or RUP&reg;, is a process platform that contains a process framework of best practices for iterative, incremental,
    software and systems development. Together they can be used to implement an effective measurement process.
</p>
<p>
    This plug-in integrates the measurement activities, artifacts, and concepts as described by PSM, replacing the
    measurement concepts provided by the Rational Unified Process base framework.
</p>
<h2>
    <a id="Start" name="Start">Where do I start?</a>
</h2>
<p>
    If you are unfamiliar with PSM and want to learn more about it, we suggest you take the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you are familiar with PSM and are interested in working with PSM on your RUP project, we simply suggest you
        start by reading the <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="_QOufl3HCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">P</a><a class="elementLink" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/guidances/roadmaps/PSM Roadmap_6CE1A8A1.html" guid="_hDwMcINcEdyR0JEkj9xWhw">Practical Software & Systems Measurement (PSM) Roadmap</a>.
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        If you are new to measurement practices in general, a good approach is to start by reading the <a href="http://www.psmsc.com/PSMBook.asp">PSM book</a>. People new to software measurement should read Chapter 1 of
        the PSM book first to get an overview of the PSM approach. People faced with the immediate task of implementing
        measurement on a program should use the more detailed guidance found in Chapters 2,3, and 4 while they are
        performing the steps necessary to select and apply measurement in real-time. Students which are more comfortable
        learning by example should read through one of the case studies in Appendix B and C. Students who need deeper
        coverage of a particular area of software measurement should refer to the bibliography, which recommends a number
        of books and reports on software measurement.

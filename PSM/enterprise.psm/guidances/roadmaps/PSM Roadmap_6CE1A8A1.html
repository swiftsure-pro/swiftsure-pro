<h4>
    <a id="Introduction" name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
</h4>
<p>
    This roadmap provides information for getting started and applying the practices of Practical Software & Systems
    Measurement (PSM) to a software or systems development project. The roadmap can be used as an introduction
    and&nbsp;guide to the content delivered in the RUP PSM Plug-In.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="About" name="About">What is&nbsp;PSM?</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Over the past twenty years, measurement has evolved from something that was a "check-in-the-box process" into a
    management best practice. Numerous case studies of successful projects and organizations have shown the value of
    measurement. It is now a key management discipline, as evidenced by its inclusion into various process standards,
    models and guidelines such as the ISO/IEC 15939 standard, <i>Software Measurement Process</i>, and the Software
    Engineering Instituteâ€™s Capability Maturity Model&reg; Integration<sup>SM</sup> (CMMI<sup>SM</sup>).
</p>
<p>
    Although it is now widely accepted that measurement is a key best practice, implementing a successful measurement
    program is still a challenge. Many projects and organizations still try to build their measurement programs around the
    <i>10 best measures</i> or try to measure so much that the program becomes a maintenance burden and fails.
</p>
<p class="Text">
    <em>Practical Software and Systems Measurement: A Foundation for Objective Project Management</em> was developed to
    meet today's software and system technical and management challenges. It describes an information-driven measurement
    process that will address the unique technical and business goals of your organization. The guidance in PSM represents
    the best practices used by measurement professionals within the software and system acquisition and engineering
    communities.

<h4>
    <a id="Characteristics" name="Characteristics">Why&nbsp;PSM</a>?
</h4>
<p>
    One of the most challenging tasks in developing and maintaining a system is to meet critical project cost, schedule,
    and technical objectives. With more complex capabilities in today's systems, effective management of development and
    maintenance efforts is a key factor in project success.
</p>
<p>
    Practical Software and Systems Measurement (PSM) was developed to meet today's software and system technical and
    management challenges. It is an information-driven measurement process that addresses the unique technical and business
    goals of an organization. The guidance in PSM represents the best practices used by measurement professionals within
    the software and system acquisition and engineering communities.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="GettingStarted" name="GettingStarted">How to Get Started</a>
</h4>
<p>
    PSM describes an approach to management by fact for software and systems project managers&nbsp;based on integrating the
    concepts of a <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="1.7289463523320947E-303">Measurement Information Model (PSM)</a>&nbsp;and a <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="2.387236931197315E-303">Measurement Process Model (PSM)</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The information needs of the decision maker drive the selection of software and systems measures and associated
    analysis techniques. This is the premise behind the widely accepted approaches to software and systems measurement,
    including&nbsp;goal/question/metric (<img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="_Uper0INWEdyR0JEkj9xWhw">Basili and Weiss, 1984</a>)&nbsp;and issue/category/measure (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/guidances/supportingmaterials/psm_bibliography_B7EBCE65.html" guid="_BC8MMIQpEdyR0JEkj9xWhw">McGarry et al., 1997</a>). Information needs result from the efforts of managers to
    influence the outcomes of projects, processes, and initiatives toward defined objectives. Information needs are usually
    derived from two sources: (1) goals that the manager seeks to acheve and (2) obstacles that hinder the achievement of
    these goals. Obstacles, also referred to as&nbsp;issues, include risks, problems, and a lack of information in a
    goal-related area. Unless there is a manager or other decision maker with an information need, measurement serves no
    purpose. The issues faced by a project manager are numerous. Typlically they include estimating and allocating project
    resources, tracking progress, and delivering products that meet customer specifications and expectations.
</p>
<p>
    A&nbsp;<img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="1.7289463523320947E-303">Measurement Information Model (PSM)</a>&nbsp;defines the relationship between the
    information needs of&nbsp;the manager and the objective data to be collected, commonly known as measures. It also
    establishes a consistent terminology for basic measurement ideas and concepts, which is critical to communicating the
    measurement information&nbsp;to decision makers. The information model in PSM defines three levels of measures, or
    quantities: (1) base measures, (2) derived measures, and (3) indicators.
</p>
<p>
    An effective measurement process must address the selection of appropriate measures as well as provide for effective
    analysis of the data&nbsp;colllected. The&nbsp;<img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="2.387236931197315E-303">Measurement Process Model (PSM)</a> describes a set of related measurement activities
    that are generally applicable in all circumstances, regardless of the specific information needs of any particular
    situation. The process consists of four iterative measurement activities: establish, plan, perform, and evaluate. This
    process is similar to the commonly seen Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/guidances/supportingmaterials/psm_bibliography_B7EBCE65.html" guid="_BC8MMIQpEdyR0JEkj9xWhw">Deming, 1986</a>).
</p>
<p>
    Recognition of a need for fact-based, objective information leads to the establishment of a measurement process for a
    project or an organization. The specific information needs of the decision makers and measurement users drive the
    selection and definition of appropriate measures during measurement planning. The resulting measurement approach
    instantiates a project-specific information model, identifies the base measures, derived measures, and indicators to be
    employed, and the analysis techniques to be applied in order to address the project's prioritized information needs.
</p>
<p>
    As the measurement plan is implemented, or performed, the required measurement data is collected and analyzed. The
    information product that results from the perform measurement activity is provided to the decision makers. Feedback
    from these measurement users helps in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the measures and measurement process so
    that they can be improved on a continuing basis.
</p>
<p>
    The PSM concepts in this plug-in evolve from extensive measurement experience and prior research by members (individual
    and organizational). The were previously introduced in sequentially released versions of Practical Software Measurement
    (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/guidances/supportingmaterials/psm_bibliography_B7EBCE65.html" guid="_BC8MMIQpEdyR0JEkj9xWhw">McGarry et al., 1997</a>),&nbsp;and&nbsp;book published, Practical Software Measurement:
    Objective Information for Decision Makers (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/guidances/supportingmaterials/psm_bibliography_B7EBCE65.html" guid="_BC8MMIQpEdyR0JEkj9xWhw">McGarry et al., 2002</a>).&nbsp;The PSM concepts were also&nbsp;formalized in ISO/IEC
    Standard 15939: "Sofware engineering -- Software measurement process" (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/guidances/supportingmaterials/psm_bibliography_B7EBCE65.html" guid="_BC8MMIQpEdyR0JEkj9xWhw">ISO/IEC 15939, 2002</a>). The measurement process model and measurement terminology from
    ISO/IEC 15939 have also been adopted as the basis of a new Measurement and Analysis Process Area in the Software
    Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) project (CMMI Development Team, 2000), as well as
    many other ISO/IEC standards.
</p>
<p>
    We highly recommend that you also read the PSM book (<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/guidances/supportingmaterials/psm_bibliography_B7EBCE65.html" guid="_BC8MMIQpEdyR0JEkj9xWhw">McGarry et. al., 2002</a>). Although many of the concepts, guidance, and
    examples&nbsp;are taken from the book, this plug-in is not intended to replace the book.
</p>

    In addition, the <a href="http://www.psmsc.com/" target="_blank">PSM Project website</a> and many additional resources
    that can be valuable to you and your organization, which are not included in this plug-in or have been upated since the
    plug-in has been released.&nbsp;

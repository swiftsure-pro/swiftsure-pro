        Measures must be simple, objective, easy to collect, easy to interpret, and hard to misinterpret.
    </li>
    <li>
        Measurement collections must be automated and non-intrusive, that is, not interfere with the activities of the
        developers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Measures must contribute to quality assessment early in the lifecycle, when efforts to improve software quality are
        effective.
    </li>
    <li>
        Measures absolute values and trends must be actively used by management personnel and engineering personnel for
        communicating progress and quality in a consistent format.
    </li>
    <li>
        The selection of a basic or more extensive set of measures will depend on the project's characteristics and
        context: if it is large or has stringent safety or reliability requirements and the development and assessment
        teams are knowledgeable about measurement, then it may be useful to collect and analyze the technical measures. The
        contract may require certain measures to be collected, or the organization may be trying to improve it skills an
        processes in particular areas. There is no simple answer to fit all circumstances, the Project Manager must select
        what is appropriate when the Measurement Plan is produced. When introducing a measurement program for the first
        time though, it is sensible to err on the side of simplicity.

<p>
    Experience has shown that most information needs can be grouped into general areas, called i<b>nformation
    categories</b>. Information categories represent key areas of concern. PSM identifies seven information categories:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Schedule and progress</b> - Addresses the achievement of project milestones and the completion of individual
        work units. A project that falls behind schedule can usually meet its delivery objectives only by eliminating
        functionality or sacrificing product quality.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Resources and cost</b> - Relates to the balance between the work to be performed and personnel resources
        assigned to the project. A project that exceeds the budgeted effort usually can recover only by reducing software
        functionality or by sacrificing product quality.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Product size and stability</b> - Addresses the stability of the functionality or capability required of the
        software. It also relates to the volume of software delivered to provide the required capability. Stability
        includes changes in functional scope or quantity. An increase in software size usually requires increasing the
        applied resources or extending the project schedule.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Product quality</b> - Addresses the ability of the delivered software product to support the user's needs
        without failure. If a poor-quality product is delivered, the burden of making it work usually falls on the assigned
        maintenance organization.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Process performance</b> - Relates to the capability of the supplier relative to the project needs. A supplier
        with a poor software development process or low productivity may have difficulty meeting aggressive project
        schedules and cost objectives.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Technology effectiveness</b> - Addresses the viability of the proposed technical approach. It addresses
        engineering approaches such as software reuse, use of commercial software components, reliance on advanced software
        development processes, and implementation of common software architectures. Cost increases and schedule delays may
        result if key elements of the proposed technical approach are not achieved.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Customer satisfaction</b> - Addresses the degree to which products and services delivered by the project meet
        the customer's expectations. Indications of satisfaction may be obtained from customer feedback and the levels of
        customer support required.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The PSM information categories help in selecting appropriate measures. This is accomplished by allocating each
    identified project information need to one or more of the seven information categories.
</p>
<p>
    Ideas about the entities that should be measured in order to satisfy an information need can also be formulated and
    organized. These ideas are called <b>measurable concepts</b>.
</p>
<p>
    The following table illustrates how you can map common information categories with associated measurable concepts and
    prospective measures.

<p>
    Please note that it is not necessary to include all measurements to receive benefit. In fact, it is possible (and
    undesireable in most cases) to measure too much and have diminishing returns. We recommend that when you first
    establish a measurement program, you start with a small set of measures and build it up based on information needs.
</p>
<p>
    The measurement process and measures also apply to small projects. The difference is in the scale of effort that is
    spent on measurement activities. Small projects typically have fewer information needs, and therefore, fewer measures.
    For those measures collected, less data is typically available. For example, while small projects often have
    information needs related to meeting schedules, there are usually only a few dozen activities tracked with a schedule,
    versus the hundreds of activities that may exist for a large project.

</h3>
<p>
    Even the smallest projects will want to track progress to determine if the project is on schedule and on budget, and if
    not, to re-estimate and determine if scope changes are needed. This minimal measurement set will therefore focus on
    progress measures.

                development activities and dates. This measure is used by project managers to objectively assess the
                progress of development against the project plan. This information need is addressed by measuring the total
                days late for all milestones.

                control board to determine whether the problem is a defect.&nbsp; Also, consider establishing a criteria or

                <b>Test Cases Attempted, Passed</b> - The ultimate measure of completeness is how much functionality has

                Thus, a very simple way to communicate progress is with a test case progress trend.

                <b>Development Effort</b> - Effort is how much time (units can be hours or days) spent completing a task
                (analysis, design, code, test, etc.) Effort is monitored to determine the scope of work required. It is
                typically used for planning similar future work.

                What will be the estimated cost for the next release? Are we currently within our allocated budget? These
                are information needs that can be answered by measuring cost.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Earned Value</b> - One of the most commonly used method ([<img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="7.755968586980351E-308">PMI96</a>]) to measure progress is Earned Value Analysis. Projects and
                organization typically track some level of development effort and cost. To get a deeper understanding of
                financial performance and to determine whether spending is according to the plan and projected program
                costs, managers use Earned Value Analysis. The simplest way to measure earned value is to take the sum of
                the original estimated effort for all completed tasks. A "percent complete" for the project can be computed
                as the earned value divided by the total original estimated effort for the project. Productivity (or
                Performance Index) is the earned value divided by the actual effort spend on the complete tasks. For
                example, suppose the coding effort has been divided into several tasks, many of which are now complete. The
                original estimate for the completed tasks was 30 effort days. The total estimated effort for the project
                was 100 days, so we can project that the project is roughly 30% complete.

                    <li>
                        The Performance Index must only be used to adjust estimates for similar tasks. Early completion of
                        requirements gathering tasks does not suggest that coding will complete more quickly. So, compute
                        the Performance Index only for similar kinds of tasks, and adjust estimates only for similar tasks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Consider other factors. Will future tasks be performed by similarly skilled staff under similar
                        conditions? Has the data been contaminated by "outliers" - tasks which were severely over-estimated
                        or under-estimated? Is time being reported consistently (for example, overtime should be included
                        even if not paid)?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Are estimates for newer tasks already accounting for the Performance Index? If so, then estimates
                        for new tasks will tend to be closer to the target, pushing the performance index closer to 100%.
                        You should either consistently re-estimate all incomplete tasks, or adopt the following practice
                        from Extreme Programming (XP)[<img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="7.755968586980351E-308">JEF01</a>] - refer to the original estimates as "points", and measure
                        new tasks in terms of these same "points" without adjusting for actual performance . The advantage
                        of "points" is that increases (or decreases) in performance can be tracked ("project velocity" in

                <p>
                    If tasks are large (more than 5 days), or there are a lot of tasks which are partially complete, you
                    may wish to factor them into your analysis. Apply a subjective "percent completion", multiply this by
                    the task's effort estimate, and include this in the earned value. Greater consistency in results is
                    obtained if there are clear rules for assigning the percent complete. For example, one rule could be
                    that a coding task is assigned no more than 80% complete until the code has passed a code review.

    <b>Product Size and Stability</b>
</p>
<p>
    Typically, organizations (or projects) choose a method of measuring product or software size. The two most most popular
    measures for software size are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Physical Size and Stability</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Lines of Code</b> - Esimated total size of the code - also know as source lines of code or SLOC. This
                may change significantly as requirements are better understood and as design solutions mature. Include
                reused software which is subject to change by the team. NOTE: The definition of a "line of code" or a
                "statement" varies widely in the industry. But the key is to be consistent on the definition within your
                organization. All projects within your organization should adopt the same definition of a "line of code".
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Function Points</b> - The function point metric was devised in 1977 by A. J. Albrecht, then of IBM, as a
                means of measuring software size and productivity. It uses functional, logical entities such as inputs,
                outputs, and inquiries as inputs into measures for software size and productivity as appose to lines of
                code. For more information about function points, vist the International Function Point Users' Group
                (IFPUG) at <a href="mailto:blorenz@us.ibm.com">mailto:blorenz@us.ibm.com</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Additionally, sizing by requirements as well as use cases are becoming more popular.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Product Quality</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Functional Correctness</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Defects</b> - It is often useful to track the trend of open and closed defects. This provides a rough
                indication as to whether there is a significant backlog of defect fixing work to be completed and how
                quickly they are being closed.
            </li>
        </ul><br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Defect Considerations</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                All change requests should not have equal weight, whether they affect one line of code or cause major
                re-design. This can be addressed by some of the following techniques: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Be aware of outliers. Change Requests which require substantial work should be identified as such
                        and be tracked as separate tasks, not bundled into a bucket of general bug fixing. If lots of tiny
                        fixes are dominating the trend, then consider grouping them so that each Change Request represents
                        a more consistent unit of work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can record more information, such as a subjective "effort category" of "less than 1 day" "1
                        day" "less than 5 days" "more than 5 days".
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can record estimated SLOCs and actual SLOCs for each Defect.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                A lack of defects being recorded may imply a lack of testing. Be aware of the level of test effort
                occurring when examining defect trends.
            </li>
        </ul>

<p>
    <b>Schedule and Progress</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Work Unit Progress</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Requirements Tested</b> - This measure is used to evaluate the status of requirements. Requirements
                progress can be shown by tracking them through various states (for example, defined, approved, implemented,
                tested). Ultimately, requirements are fully satisfied when they are tested.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use Case Developed</b> - This measure is used to evaluate the status of use case development. Use cases
                can be shown by tracking them through various states such as defined, approved, developed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Design Model Developed</b> - This measure is used to evaluate the status of the design model. Design
                model development can be shown by tracking design elements (such as packages, classes, diagrams, etc).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Scenarios Developed</b> - This measure is used to evaluate the status of the scenario development.
                Scenarios can be shown by tracking when they are defined as well as the completeness of the scenarios.
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Experience Level</b> - Level of experience can directly affect both schedules (delivering early,
                on-time, or late) and quality. Therefore, this measure can be important to track. In particular, this
                measure is often tracked at the organization and the executive levels.

                <b>Requirements</b> - Managing requirements is a key best practice for software and systems development.
                Monitoring and controlling requirements are good practices for effective project management. Requirements
                that are not agreed upon by all stakeholders (unstable) can result in delivering the wrong system and/or a
                delay in the schedule.

                internal project, a large system, or a product that will be developed and sold. Constant feedback and
                monitoring of the feedback results is a better understanding of the user needs as well as improved customer

<h3>
    <a id="Add-onMeasures" name="Add-onMeasures">"Add-on" Measures</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Add-on measures are additional measures that are usually important in either a certain phase of a project or if there
    is an underlying need for additional information in an area. For example, if a command and control system is being
    built that requires maximum performance, reliability, and response time, then tests for system utilization, throughput,
    and mean-time-to-failure are important measures that should be "added" and tracked.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Schedule and Progress</b>
</p>
<ul>

        <b>Work Unit Progress</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Change Requests Opened, Resolved</b> - This measure is used to evaluate the status of change requests
                for enhancements. Oftentime, this measure is tracked after a product is released and requests for
                enhancements start being submitted.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>

        <b>Incremental Capability</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Components Integrated</b> - This measure is a product of incremental development. It is useful to assess
                if the incremental builds are being completed as scheduled.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Functionality Integrated</b> - This measure is also a product of incremental development.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Staff Turnover</b> - This is an important measure to track if the project is experience increasing staff
                turnover. Increasing turnover can result in schedule slip and higher costs as new members must go through a
                training period before becoming productive.

                <b>Age of Defects</b> - This measure becomes more important when a product or project is mature or has been
                released. If this indicator shows that age of defects increases, this may indicate a problem in quality -
                defects are not be resolved - and the lack of resources to fix defects
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Defect Density</b> - This measure can be used to evaluate code quality by monitoring the number of

            <li>
                <b>Utilization, Throughput, Response Time</b> - Projects that have system requirements for efficiency may
                wish to track measurements for system utilization, data/messaging throughput, and user interface response
                time.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Mean-Time-to-Failure</b> - On a project that requires high reliability, such as a command and control
                system, or perhaps an air traffic control system, reliability is an important information need and
                mean-time-to-failure is an effective measure that can be tracked.

                <b>Productivity</b> - The efficiency of the software development process can be evaluated by comparing
                achieved productivity to bid rates. Productivity provides an indication of the amount of work produced
                relative to the effort expended. Lower than expected productivity may lead to effort and cost overruns.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Defects Contained</b> - Tracking when defects are fixed. Which phase (or when) defects are detected and
                which phase they are fixed can provide insight into the quality of the development process.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Defects Escaping</b> - Tracking defects that are escaping a phase and "living" into a new phase.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Rework Effort, Components</b> - Rework corresponds to the an increase in quality. It also can show the
                effectiveness of the process. For example, certain amounts of rework is necessary in any software
                development process. Early rework is a good sign of progress since rework early is less expensive that
                rework late. Continuous rework, late rework, or even zero rework due to the absence of a configured
                baseline are indicators of negative quality and possibly a problem in the process.

    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <b>Technology Effectiveness</b>
</p>
<p>
    Projects that rely heavily on new technology, off-the-shelf products, or advanced technology may want to consider the
    following measures.

        <b>Technology Volatility</b> 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Baseline Changes</b> - If the software package results in baseline changes (both expected and
                unexpected), then cost increases and schedule delays may result.
            </li>
        </ul>

                monitoring of the feedback results is a better understanding of the user needs as well as improved customer
                relations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Award Fee</b> - Award fees based on cost, schedule and milestone achievements that exceed expected
                results can be used to gauge customer levels of satisfaction.

                <b>Requests for Support</b> - Increasing requests for support can be a sign of a complex product or system
                which can result in an increasingly dissatisfied customer.

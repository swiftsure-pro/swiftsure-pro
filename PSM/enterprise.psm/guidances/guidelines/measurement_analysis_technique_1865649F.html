    Fundamental software measurement analysis concepts were introduced in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/tasks/psm_perform_measurement_164F97B2.html" guid="_QO0mNXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Task: Perform Measurement (PSM)</a>. The three primary types of analysis
    are presented here:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Estimation</strong>: Producing estimates of size, effort, schedule, and quality
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Feasibility</strong> <strong>analysis</strong>: Assessing the feasibility of project plans during initial
        planning and replanning activities
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Performance analysis</strong>: Assessing the project's actual performance against plans throughout the
        project.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These three measurement activities are usually performed iteratively throughout the project's life cycle.
</p>
<p>
    Early in the software project, measurement focuses on estimation to support project planning. The output of estimation
    is the primary input to the project planning process. As project planning nears completion, feasibility analysis helps
    to determine whether or not project plans and targets are realistic and achievable. Both estimation and feasibility
    analysis use historical data extensively. The resulting project plans are then used to direct project execution.
    Performance analysis determines whether the project is meeting defined plans, assumptions, and targets. When
    performance deviates from plans or when requirements, constraints, or assumptions change, project teams should
    re-examine and revise their estimates and re-plan their work accordingly.
</p>
<h3>
    Estimation
</h3>
<p>
    <em>Estimation</em> produces quantitative projections of key project attributes. Software project projections typically
    include product size, amount of required effort, and project duration or schedule. The expected level of product
    quality also may be estimated. These projections, or forecasts, form the basis for initial project plans. Estimation
    results in effort and schedule expectations that are used throughout project planning and execution.
</p>
<p>
    Estional is usually the first type of measurement analysis performed on most projects. The initial round of estimation
    often occurs early in the project, before the project team is even selected. These initial estimates often establish
    overall funding and schedule commitments. However, early estimates are often imprecise. They must be updated throughout
    the project life cycle. Estimation should be performed at various times during a project, and the resulting measures
    should be used to update plans and track performance.
</p>
<p>
    Poor estimates and misconceptions about the estimating process often contribute to failed projects. In many cases, poor
    estimates lead to planning targets that are impossible to achieve. Implementing such plans results in missed deadlines,
    inadequate performance, and poor software quality. Poor estimation can be attributed to a number of factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Lack of estimating experience
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of historical data on which to base estimates
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of a systematic estimation process, sound techniques, or models suited to project's needs
    </li>
    <li>
        Failure to include essential project activities and products within the scope of the estimates
    </li>
    <li>
        Unrealistic expectations or assumptions
    </li>
    <li>
        Failure to recognize and address the uncertainty inherent in project estimates
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Using the Integrated Analysis Model for Estimation
</h3>
<p>
    The Integrated Analysis Model described in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/tasks/psm_perform_measurement_164F97B2.html" guid="_QO0mNXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Task: Perform Measurement (PSM)</a>&nbsp;is used to support the software
    estimation projcess. Upstream elements drive the estimation of downstream elements. For example, software size is the
    primary input to effort estimation. As product size projections increase, the project effort projections also increase.
    Similarly, effort serves as the primary input to most schedule estimation approaches. Additionally, most estimation
    approaches also recognize that the project's use of technology and the expected level of process performance represent
    <em>performance factors</em> that must be accounted for in the estimates.
</p>
<p>
    Actually, any element in the Integrated Analysis Model that is upstream from another given element can be used as a
    basis for estimation. However, the strongest relationships are found between elements pictured close together in the
    model.
</p>
<p>
    For more information on estimation, refer to Chapter&nbsp;5 of the PSM book&nbsp;[MGC01]&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/guidances/supportingmaterials/psm_references_B1BAE46C.html" guid="_QO0mTXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Supporting Material: PSM References</a><br />
</p>
<h3>
    Feasibility Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    <em>Feasibility analysis</em> evaluates the accuracy and realism of project plans. For a project plan to be feasible,
    the indivdual elements of the plan must be technically realistic and achievable, and the elements must be consistent in
    relation to each other.
</p>
<p>
    When there&nbsp;is a&nbsp;feasibility problem, only parts of the overall project plan may be unrealistic. It is
    important to recognize and correct those situations to ensure project success. Feasibility analyses should be performed
    thoroughout the software life cycle as plans are developed and revised. Research has shown that two of the main reasons
    software projects fail are a lack of planning and unrealistic plans and objectives.
</p>
<p>
    Three types of situations should be examined during feasibility analysis:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Feasibility analysis of measures related to the project's high-priority information needs should be performed. The
        analysis should look at any plans assoicated with high-priority project information needs (such as schedule) to
        check the plans for accuracy and consistency. The analyst should review the schedule at a a high level (such as
        milestone schedules) and at a low level (such as work unit progress) of detail.
    </li>
    <li>
        Plan elements that are upstream from the high-priority information needs should be assessed individually because
        their validity will influence the feasibility of downstream plans. For example, if a primary concern is schedule,
        and the schedule plan looks feasible, effort should also be reviewed. Schedule could still be jeopardized if the
        amount of planned effort is unrealistic.
    </li>
    <li>
        Plan elments should be assessed for consistency with other project information. For example, even if the individual
        elements of schedule and effort allication are feasible, they may not be synchronized with staff availability.
        These situations must be recognized and resolved to maximize project success.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For more information on estimation, refer to Chapter 5 of the PSM book [MGC01]&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/guidances/supportingmaterials/psm_references_B1BAE46C.html" guid="_QO0mTXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Supporting Material: PSM References</a><br />
</p>
<h3>
    Performance Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    <em>Performance analysis</em> deterimines if the project is meeting its plans and targets. Regardless of its
    feasibility, once a project has committed to a plan, performance can be measured against the plan. The project manager
    must pay close attention to how well the project adheres to the plan. Even when the project begins with a good plan, if
    performance begins to deviate from the plan, the reasons for the deviation must be identified and corrective actions
    must be taken to ensure success. The goal of performance analysis is to provide information for making decisions <em>in
    time to affect the project outcome</em>. Performance analysis should be conducted regularly throughout the project's
    life cycle.
</p>
<p>
    The guidance in this section is not intended as a prescriptive apprach to performance analysis. The process must be
    flexible in analyzing important project issues. Performance analysis should be viewed as an investigative activity in
    which measurement analysis is used to track down and isolate problems. This may require the use of slightly different
    data, the generation of different indicators, and the identification of alternative courses of actions each time
    performance is analyzed. The following sections describe several analsysis tools and a straightforward process for
    gaining insight into project performance.
</p>
<h4>
    Using the Integrated Analysis Model for Performance Analysis
</h4>
<p>
    The Integrated Analsysi Model described in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../enterprise.psm/tasks/psm_perform_measurement_164F97B2.html" guid="_QO0mNXHCEdyhH6NzIpyxlQ">Task: Perform Measurement (PSM)</a>&nbsp;serves as a useful performance
    analsysis "road map". It leads to several implications for analyzing project performance:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Projects need direct measures of their high-priority information needs. If the concern is staying within cost, then
        cost indicators should be monitored regularly. However, if the high-priority information need is downstream in the
        model, by the time a problem becomes visible, it may represent a significant threat to project success.
    </li>
    <li>
        Always monitor elements that are upstream from the primary information needs because they represent <em>leading
        indicators</em> for those information needs. For example, requirements changes usually precede size and effort
        increases. If the primary concern is staying within a fixed cost, effort should be measured along with product
        size, process performance, and technology effectiveness.
    </li>
    <li>
        When investigating problems, the relationships between multiple information categories should be considered.
        Sometimes a variety of factors are contributing to a specific problem.
    </li>
    <li>
        When evaulating alternatives, always weigh the trade-offs between information categories. Optimizing a primary
        information need may negatively impact another information need that is equally important to project sucess. For
        example, attempting to make up a schedule slippage by increasing the number of peronnel increases overall cost.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sometimes two related indicators suggest different situations. Neither variance alone may be large enough to
        suggest a problem, but taken together, they indicate that an element is not working as planned.
    </li>
    <li>
        Individual points that are not part of a trend, but that show unusual behavior, should also be investigated.
        Examples include a large change in productivity, error rate, or complexity.
    </li>
</ul>

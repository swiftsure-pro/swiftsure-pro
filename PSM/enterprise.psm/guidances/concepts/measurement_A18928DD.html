    <a id="KeyConceptsAndPractices" name="KeyConceptsAndPractices">Key Concepts and Practices</a>
</h3>
<p>
    All successful software organizations implement measurement as part of their day-to-day management and technical
    activities. Measurement provides the objective information they need to make informed decisions that positively impact
    their business and engineering performance. In successful software organizations, measurement-derived information is
    treated as an important resource, and is made available to decision makers throughout all levels of management.
</p>
<p>
    Software measurement has evolved into a key software engineering discipline. In the past, many software organizations
    treated measurement as an additional, non-value-added task or just "another thing to do." Measurement is now considered
    to be a basic software engineering practice, as evidenced by its inclusion in the Level 2 maturity requirements of the
    Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model - Integrated, and related commercial software process
    standards.
</p>
<p>
    The way measurement is actually implemented and used in a software organization determines how much value is realized
    in terms of business and engineering performance. Measurement is most effective when implemented in support of an
    organization's business and technical objectives, and when it is integrated with the existing technical and management
    activities that comprise a software project. Measurement works best when it provides objective information related to
    the risks and problems that may impact a project's defined objectives. In other words, measurement works best when it
    is considered a significant, integral part of project management.
</p>
<p>
    Top-performing organizations design their technical and management processes to make use of objective, fact-based,
    measurement data. Measurement data and associated analysis results support both short- and long-term decision-making. A
    mature software development organization typically uses measurement to help plan and evaluate a proposed software
    project, to objectively track actual performance against defined planning objectives, to guide software process
    improvement decisions and investments, and to help assess overall business and technical performance against
    market-driven requirements. A top-performing organization uses measurement across the entire life cycle of a software
    project, from inception to retirement. Measurement is implemented as a proactive discipline, and measurement-derived
    information is considered to be a strategic resource.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="MotivationForMeasurement" name="MotivationForMeasurement">Motivation for Measurement</a> <a id="XE_metrics__motivation_for" name="XE_metrics__motivation_for"></a>
</h4>
<p>
    Why measure software? To begin, software has become a major factor in corporate investment and business strategies,
    even for non-software intensive organizations. It is a key component with respect to an organization's ability to
    maintain pace with rapidly changing information technology in an increasingly competitive environment. Given the large
    corporate investment in developing and maintaining critical information assets, there is a growing demand for more
    objective assessment and management of software-intensive projects.
</p>
<p>
    Measurement is most important at the project level. Software measurement helps the project manager do a better job. It
    helps to define and implement more realistic plans, to properly allocate scarce resources to put those plans into
    place, and to accurately monitor progress and performance against those plans. Software measurement provides the
    information required to make key project decisions and to take appropriate action. Measurement helps to relate and
    integrate the information derived from other project and technical management disciplines. In effect, it allows the
    software project manager to make decisions using objective, fact-based information.
</p>
<p>
    Specifically, software measurement provides objective information to help the project manager:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Communicate Effectively</b> - measurement provides objective information throughout the software organization.
        This reduces the ambiguity that often surrounds complex and constrained software projects. Measurement helps
        managers to identify, prioritize, track, and communicate objectives and associated issues at all levels within the
        organization. It also is important to communicating between supplier and acquirer organizations.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Track Specific Project Objectives -</b> measurement can accurately describe the status of software project
        processes and products. It is a key discipline in objectively representing the progress of project activities and
        the quality of associated software products across the project life cycle. Measurement helps to answer key
        questions such as: "Is the project on schedule?" and "Is the software ready to be delivered to the user?"<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Identify and Correct Problems Early</b> - measurement facilitates a proactive management strategy. Potential
        problems are objectively identified as risks to be assessed and managed. Existing problems can be better evaluated
        and prioritized. Measurement focuses attention on the early discovery and correction of technical and management
        problems that can be more difficult and costly to resolve later. Managers use measurement as a resource to
        anticipate problems and to avoid being forced into a "reactive," fix-on-fail approach.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Make Key Tradeoff Decisions -</b> every software project is subject to constraints. Cost, schedule, capability,
        technical quality, and performance must be traded off and managed together to meet established project objectives.
        Decisions in one area almost always impact other areas, even if they seem to be unrelated. Measurement helps the
        decision maker to objectively assess these impacts and make informed tradeoffs to best meet project objectives and
        to optimize software project and product performance.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Defend and Justify Decisions -</b> the current software and Information Technology business environments
        emphasize successful project performance. Business, technical, and project managers must be able to effectively
        defend and justify resource allocation and performance-related decisions. Measurement provides an effective
        rationale for selecting the best alternatives.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Like any management or technical tool, measurement cannot guarantee that a project will be successful. However, it does
    help the decision maker take a proactive approach in dealing with the critical issues inherent in software-intensive
    projects. Measurement helps the project, and, consequently, the organization to succeed.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="MeasurementAsDiscriminator" name="MeasurementAsDiscriminator">Measurement as an Organizational Discriminator</a>
</h4>
<p>
    The current software business environment is characterized by rapidly changing technology within an extremely
    competitive market. In both the shrink-wrapped and unique application software marketplace, customers demand more
    functionality at a lower price and rapid implementation of any new capability that satisfies their changing business
    demands. In today's environment, it is becoming increasingly difficult to establish a software organization as an
    information technology market leader, and even more difficult to maintain it as a top performing organization -- an
    organization that performs better that its competitors from both technical and business perspectives.
</p>
<p>
    Experience has shown that almost every top-performing organization can be described as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Accurate, objective information is available to all decision makers and its use is an integral part of the
        corporate culture.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Past, present, and future business and technical perspectives are maintained to help define project objectives and
        performance expectations.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizational processes and procedures are designed to identify, characterize, and manage change. Dealing with
        change is part of how the organization does business.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        Both good and bad news is freely communicated within the organization. Issues are openly identified and
        addressed.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a cultural bias for decision-making and taking action.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        These characteristics are all information-related, and therefore measurement-related. To be a top performer in its
        sector, an organization needs the right kind of information, on a regular basis, to make the right decisions. It
        uses information to become more efficient and to produce better quality products. Measurement facilitates and
        accelerates organizational learning and supports corporate adaptation within the marketplace. Measurement provides
        a structure for learning from each project, whether or not it was a good experience. Measurement also helps an
        organization understand the gaps between how they are actually performing and the performance levels demanded by
        the marketplace. It allows an organization to optimize within its business and technical constraints. In effect,
        measurement information becomes a competitive resource and an effective measurement process becomes an
        organizational discriminator.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <a id="FoundationProjectMeasurement" name="FoundationProjectMeasurement">The Foundation - Project Measurement</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Given measurement's strong relationship to software organizational performance, the key challenge is to implement it in
    a manner that has the most positive impact on each of the projects within the organization. The foundation of any
    organizational software measurement program is established at the project level. An organization's performance is
    essentially based on the success of its projects. To be successful, project and technical managers must make critical
    decisions related to project resources, schedule, and functional capability on a continuous basis. These decisions must
    result in optimizing the business and technical performance of the software product within organizational and market
    driven constraints. There is little room for project rework and restarts.
</p>
<p>
    The software project manager must integrate all of the diverse aspects of software to be successful. Decisions are made
    daily, if not hourly, on how the technical product will be developed and managed, how resources will be allocated, and
    which issues will be addressed in what priority. The more effective these decisions are, the more successful the
    project. The more objective the available data and information, the better the decisions. The project manager usually
    must guide the project towards predefined, planned project objectives, while operating within established constraints.
</p>
<p>
    The project environment is generally one of multiple and diverse cost, schedule, and technical considerations.
    Experience shows that even in relatively small Information Technology organizations, each project is unique in terms of
    domain application, implemented technical processes, operational interdependencies with other systems, and the
    aforementioned constraints. Add in the usual and sometimes continuous technical and management changes, and each
    project emerges with distinct process and product characteristics.
</p>
<p>
    The organizational measurement approach must be adaptable to effectively address the unique information needs and
    characteristics of each project. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Practical Software Measurement</i> focuses on
    project-level measurement and shows how measurement can be tailored to satisfy the needs of each project.
</p>
<p>
    Although the project is the primary focus in implementing measurement within an organization, there are valid
    information needs at higher organizational management levels. In almost all cases, objective organizational-level
    information is derived from the projects. You need good project data to analyze overall organization. Organizational
    software measurement can be viewed as measurement across many programs, validly combining the measurement data
    generated by each project, and using different analysis techniques to satisfy different information needs. For example,
    managers at many different organizational levels may be concerned with how long it takes to develop and field a given
    software product. The project manager is concerned with the time it takes to implement product capability and
    reliability, and in developing the software product within cost objectives. The marketing or business manager may be
    concerned with the time it takes to market a new capability and the potential impact of a possible delay on market
    share. The process manager may be concerned with an overall increase or decrease of the average software-development
    timeline for all of the organization's products, and the related impacts from organizational process changes. In all
    cases, the key variable is the availability of quality data at the project level. In fact, most corporate measurement
    activities take place at the project level.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="WhatMakesMeasurementWork" name="WhatMakesMeasurementWork">What Makes Measurement Work?</a>
</h4>
<p>
    There have been many different approaches used to implement software measurement on a software-intensive project. Not
    all of them have been effective, and many have not even outlived the project itself. Some of these approaches have been
    based on the detailed definition of the "best" set of measures equally applicable to every project in the organization.
    Others have relied on automated measurement and analysis tools purchased from a vendor with little regard for the
    organization's processes or business practices that were already in place. In both of these cases, measurement became
    just "something else to do" and did not materially help the project achieve its objectives. What makes measurement work
    in an already challenging project environment? Experience across a wide range of software development and maintenance
    projects suggests that there are two key characteristics of a successful measurement program:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The collection, analysis, and reporting of measurement data that relates directly to the <b>information needs</b>
        of the project decision makers. This can be characterized as an information-driven measurement approach, where
        measures are defined and implemented to address the specific information needs of the project on a prioritized
        basis, as defined by established project objectives and associated issues. As the project progresses and the
        information needs change, so do the applied measures. Inherent to the information-driven measurement approach is a
        clear understanding of the relationships between what information is needed, what is actually measured, and how the
        measures are defined and combined into usable results.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
    <li>
        A structured and repeatable <b>measurement process</b> that establishes project measurement activities and related
        information interfaces. This process must be flexible and adaptable to support existing software technical and
        management processes and environments already in place, as well as to support the characteristics of the specific
        application domain. The measurement process must be iterative, continuously focusing measurement efforts on the
        most critical issues. The measurement process is in place throughout the existence of the project. It supports the
        measurement of evolving process and product attributes as project information needs, and related objectives and
        issues, change.<br />
        <br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both the information-driven measurement approach and the measurement process work together on a continuous basis during
    the project life cycle, providing different information to the project managers as their needs change. Both are
    tailored to meet the specific characteristics of each project. Together they provide a basis for measurement tasks and
    procedures that support successful project completion and improved business and engineering performance.
</p>
<p>
    To be effective, measurement must be implemented within a project or organization as a supporting software engineering
    process. As such, measurement must include all of the activities associated with planning, performing, and evaluating
    measurement-related tasks within an overall project or organizational structure. Measurement does not stand alone. It
    is implemented within the project environment to define what information the decision makers need, and how this
    information is collected, analyzed, presented, and used. The measurement process combines diverse subjective and
    objective data into integrated information products that directly address defined project information needs.

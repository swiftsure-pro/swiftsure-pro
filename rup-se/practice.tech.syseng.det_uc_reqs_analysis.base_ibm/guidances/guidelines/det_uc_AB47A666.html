    1. Review and Refine the Scenarios
</h4>
<p>
    Start by reviewing and refining the scenarios that you will be dealing with in the current development cycle. These may
    have already been initially identified during the previous activities. Use these enumerated scenarios as a starting
    point in determining the scope of what flows will need to be described.
</p>
<h4>
    2. Detail the Flow of Events
</h4>
<p>
    Use the outline as a starting point, and gradually make it more detailed.
</p>
<p>
    Describe the use case according to the standards decided for the project. Decide on the following points before
    describing the use case so that you are consistent across use cases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How does the use case start? The start of the use case must clearly describe the signal that activates the use
        case. Write, for example, "The use case can start when ... happens."
    </li>
    <li>
        How does the use case terminate? You should clearly state whatever happens in the course of the flow to terminate
        the use case. Write, for example, "When ... happens, the use case terminates."
    </li>
    <li>
        How does the use case interact with actors? To minimize any risk of misunderstanding say exactly what will reside
        inside the system, and what will reside outside the system. Structure the description as a series of paragraphs, in
        which each paragraph expresses an action in the format: "When the actor does ..., the system does ...." You can
        also emphasize interaction by writing that the use case sends and receives signals from actors, for example: "The
        use case starts when it receives the signal 'start' from the Operator."
    </li>
    <li>
        How does the use case exchange data with an actor? If you like, you can refer to the arguments of the signals, but
        it might be better to write, for example, "The use case starts when the User logs into the system by giving his
        name and password."
    </li>
    <li>
        How does the use case repeat some behavior? You should try to express this in natural language. However, in
        exceptional cases, it might be worthwhile to use code-like constructs, such as "WHILE-END WHILE," "IF-THEN-ELSE,"
        and "LOOP-END LOOP," if the corresponding natural language terms are difficult to express. In general, however, you
        should avoid using such code-like constructs in use-case descriptions because they are hard to read and maintain.
    </li>
    <li>
        Are there any optional situations in a use case's flow of events? Sometimes an actor is presented with several
        options. This should be written in the same way. For example: 
        <p>
            "The actor chooses one of the following, one or more times:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                a) . . .
            </p>
            <p>
                b) . . .
            </p>
            <p>
                c) . . ." etc.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        How should the use case be described so that the customer and the users can understand it? The use of
        methodology-specific terminology, such as use case, actor, and signal, might make the text unnecessarily hard to
        grasp. To make the text easier to read, you might enumerate the actions, or adopt some other strategy. Whatever
        strategy you use should be specified in the general use-case-modeling guidelines so that you keep it in mind during
        the entire task of describing use cases.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Concentrate on describing what is done in the use case, not how specific problems internal to the system should be
    solved. Those details will be considered when later in the lifecycle, so do not make the description overly detailed at
    this point. Describe only what you believe will be stable later on.
</p>
<p>
    If a use case's flow of events has become too encompassing or complex, or if it appears to have parts that are
    independent of one another, split it into two or more use cases.
</p>
<p>
    When you write the descriptive text, refer to a glossary. As fresh terms evolve from new concepts, include them in the
    glossary. Do not change the definition of a term without informing the appropriate project members.
</p>
<p>
    A flow of events description explores:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        How and when the use case starts.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the use case interacts with the actors, and what data they exchange.
    </li>
    <li>
        How and when the use case uses data stored in the system, or stores data in the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        How and when the use case ends.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You should also describe odd or exceptional flows of events. An exceptional flow is a subflow of the use case that does
    not adhere to the use case's normal or basic behavior. This flow may nevertheless be necessary in any complete
    description of the use case's behavior. A typical example of an exceptional flow is the one given in the first example.
    If the use case receives some unexpected data (that the actor is not the one expected in that particular context) it
    terminates. Having the wrong actor and terminating prematurely are not in the typical flow of events.
</p>
<p>
    Other "do's and don'ts" to consider when you describe a use case include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Describe the flow of events, not just the use case's functionality or purpose.
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe only flows that belong to the use case, not what is going on in other use cases that work in parallel with
        it.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not mention actors who do not communicate with the use case in question.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not provide too much detail when you describe the use case's interaction with any actor.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the order of the subflows described for the use case does not have to be fixed, do not describe it as if it does
        have to be fixed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the terms in the common glossary and consider the following in writing the text:
    </li>
    <li>
        Use straightforward vocabulary. Don't use a complex term when a simple one will do.
    </li>
    <li>
        Write short, concise sentences.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid adverbs, such as very, more, rather, and the like.
    </li>
    <li>
        Use correct punctuation.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid compound sentences.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    From a systems engineering perspective, it is better that the use-case description be kept 'black box' at this stage,
    and constructed around the view of actor action, system input, black-box step (what the system does) and system output
    (which might flow to other actors). Description of what the system <i>might</i> do internally (to produce the response)
    might be necessary, but in no way constrains the system design. When such descriptions are written, they typically use
    terminology well-understood in the domain. They might refer to the <i>state</i> of the system (for example, when the
    response is conditional upon that state) and <i>stores</i> that the system notionally contains. This, however, reveals
    nothing about how the system maintains such state or stores internally, only requiring that it behaves (in its history
    of interactions) as if it did.
</p>
<h4>
    3. Structure the Flow of Events
</h4>
<p>
    A use case's flow of events can be divided into several subflows. When the use case is activated the subflows can
    combine in various ways if the following holds true:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The use case can proceed from one of several possible paths, depending on the input from a given actor, or the
        values of some attribute or object. For example, an actor can decide, from several options, what to do next, or,
        the flow of events may differ if a value is less or greater than a certain value.
    </li>
    <li>
        The use case can perform some subflows in optional sequences.
    </li>
    <li>
        The use case can perform several subflows at the same time.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You must describe all these optional or alternative flows. It is recommended that you describe each subflow in a
    separate supplement to the Flow of Events section, and should be mandatory for the following cases:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Subflows that occupy a large segment of a given flow of events.
    </li>
    <li>
        Exceptional flows of events. This helps the use case's basic flow of events to stand out more clearly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any subflow that can be executed at several intervals in the same flow of events.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If a subflow involves only a minor part of the complete flow of events, it is better to describe it in the body of the
    text.
</p>
<h4>
    4. Illustrate Relationships with Actors and other Use Cases
</h4>
<p>
    Create use-case diagrams showing the use case and its relationships to actors and other use cases. A diagram of this
    type functions as a local diagram of the use case, and should be related to it. Note that this kind of local use-case
    diagram is typically of little value, unless the use case has use-case relationships that need to be explained, or if
    there is an unusual complexity among the actors involved.
</p>
<h4>
    5. Describe any Special Requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Any requirements that can be related to the use case, but that are not taken into consideration in the Flow of Events
    of the use case, should be described in the Special Requirements of the use case. Such requirements are likely to be
    nonfunctional. This step has particular significance in systems engineering: because you intend to flow down
    non-functional requirements to subsystems, the tracking and allocation of such requirements must be done with some
    rigor
</p>
<h4>
    6. Define Communication Protocols
</h4>
<p>
    Define the communication protocol to be used for any actor that is another system or external hardware. If some
    existing protocol (especially recognized protocols or protocols considered standard) is to be used, the description of
    the use case should simply name the protocol. If the protocol is new, you should point to where the protocol definition
    can be found which will need to be fully described during object-model development.
</p>
<p>
    This step has special significance in systems engineering, because it is likely that the system will interact with
    several external systems or pieces of hardware. Previously you produced a broad description of what is exchanged in the
    actor-system use-case association (with each association). Now you elaborate that description by selecting a protocol
    for it.
</p>
<h4>
    7. Describe Preconditions
</h4>
<p>
    A precondition on a use case explains the state the system must be in order for the use case to be possible to start.
</p>
<p>
    Take care to describe the system state; avoid describing the detail of other incidental tasks that may have taken place
    prior to this use case.
</p>
<p>
    Preconditions are not used to create a sequence of use cases. There will never be a case where you have to first
    perform one use case, then another, in order to have a meaningful flow of events. If you feel there is a need to do
    this, it is likely that you have decomposed the use-case model too much. Correct this problem by combining the
    sequentially dependent use cases into a single use case. If this makes the resulting&nbsp; use case too complex,
    consider techniques for structuring use cases.
</p>
<h4>
    8. Describe Postconditions
</h4>
<p>
    A postcondition on a use case lists possible states the system can be in at the end of the use case. The system must be
    in one of those states at the end of the execution of the use case. It is also used to state actions that the system
    performs at the end of the use case, regardless of what occurred in the use case.
</p>
<p class="example">
    Postconditions are used to reduce the complexity and improve the readability of the flow-of-events of the use case.
</p>
<p>
    Under no circumstances should postconditions be used to create a sequence of use cases. There should never be a case
    where you have to first perform one use case, then another, in order to have a meaningful flow of events. If you feel a
    need to do this, the sequentially dependent use cases should be combined into a single use case. If this makes the
    combined use case too complex, consider techniques for structuring use cases.
</p>
<h4>
    9. Describe Extension Points
</h4>
<p>
    If the use case is to be extended by another use case, you need to describe what the extension points are.
</p>
<h4>
    10. Evaluate your Results
</h4>
<p>
    Review and discuss the use case with the stakeholders, so that they have a clear understanding of the use case and
    agree on its description.
</p>
<p>
    The use-case description is complete only when it describes everything the use case performs, implements, or otherwise
    allows from beginning to end. Before you finish, check that the use case exhibits the properties that characterize it
    as a "good" use case.<br />

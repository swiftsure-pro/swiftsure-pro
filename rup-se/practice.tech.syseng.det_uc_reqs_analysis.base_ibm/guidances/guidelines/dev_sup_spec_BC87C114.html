    1. Capture non-use-case-specific functional requirements
</h4>
<p>
    Functional requirements describe the behaviors (functions or services) of the system that support user goals, tasks or
    activities [Ruth Malan and Dana Bredemeyer 2001. <i>Defining Non-Functional Requirements</i>. White paper, <a href="http://www.bredemeyer.com/">http://www.bredemeyer.com/</a>].
</p>
<p>
    While many of the functional requirements will be documented in Use Cases, there are some functional requirements that
    cannot be applied to specific use cases. For example, reporting, auditing, printing, security, licensing
    support/enforcement, authentication requirements, etc. Such functional requirements should be documented in the
    Supplementary Specification.
</p>
<p>
    If there are a significant number of system-wide functional requirements, it is important to give some thought into the
    organization of this section. A typical organization is by feature/feature set, but alternative organization methods
    are also possible. For example, organization by user or organization by subsystem, may also be appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    Functional requirements represent the 'F' in "FURPS+.
</p>
<h4>
    2. Capture system qualities
</h4>
<p>
    Non-functional requirements include both qualities&nbsp;and constraints [Ruth Malan and Dana Bredemeyer 2001.
    <i>Defining Non-Functional Requirements</i>. White paper, <a href="http://www.bredemeyer.com/">http://www.bredemeyer.com/</a>].&nbsp; In this step we discuss qualities.&nbsp;
    Constraints are addressed in a separate step.
</p>
<p>
    [System] qualities are properties or characteristics of the system that its stakeholders care about and hence will
    affect their degree of satisfaction with the system [Ruth Malan and Dana Bredemeyer 2001. <i>Defining Non-Functional
    Requirements</i>. White paper, <a href="http://www.bredemeyer.com/">http://www.bredemeyer.com/</a>].
</p>
<p>
    Qualities represent the "URPS" in "FURPS+".&nbsp; The concerns of each of these categories of requirements is as
    follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>U</strong>sability:&nbsp;&nbsp;Aesthetics and consistency in the user interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>R</strong>eliability:&nbsp;&nbsp;Availability (the amount of system "up time"), accuracy of system
        calculations, and the system's ability to recover from failure.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>P</strong>erformance: Throughput, response time, recovery time, start-up time, and shutdown time.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>S</strong>upportability: Testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility, configurability,
        installability, scalability, and localizability.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending on the number of qualities to be documented for the system, you may want to provide sub-sections for each of
    these quality types.
</p>
<p>
    The following sections provide some examples of the kids of information you might want to capture for each of these
    qualities:
</p>
<h5>
    Usability
</h5>
<p>
    When describing usability requirements, you may want to specify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Required training time for a normal users and power users to become productive at particular operations
    </li>
    <li>
        Measurable task times for typical tasks
    </li>
    <li>
        Requirements to conform to common usability standards, for example, IBM's CUA standards or Microsoft's GUI
        standards
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Reliability
</h5>
<p>
    When describing reliability requirements, you may want to specify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Availability – specify percentage of time available ( xx.xx%), hours of use, maintenance access, degraded mode
        operations, and the like.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) – this is usually specified in hours but it could also be specified in terms of
        days, months or years.
    </li>
    <li>
        Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) – how long is the system allowed to be out of operation after it has failed?
    </li>
    <li>
        Accuracy – specify precision (resolution) and accuracy (by some known standard) that is required in the systems
        output.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maximum bugs or defect rate – usually expressed in terms of bugs/KLOC (thousands of lines of code), or
        bugs/function-point.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bugs or defect rate – categorized in terms of minor, significant, and critical bugs: the requirement(s) must define
        what is meant by a "critical" bug; for example, complete loss of data or complete inability to use certain parts of
        the functionality of the system.
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Performance
</h5>
<p>
    When describing performance requirements, you may want to specify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Response time for a transaction(average, maximum)
    </li>
    <li>
        Throughput (for example, transactions per second)
    </li>
    <li>
        Capacity (for example, the number of customers or transactions the system can accommodate)
    </li>
    <li>
        Degradation modes (what is the acceptable mode of operation when the system has been degraded in some manner)
    </li>
    <li>
        Resource use: memory, disk, communications, and so forth
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When documenting performance requirements, be sure to include specific response times. Where applicable, reference
    related use cases&nbsp;by name.
</p>
<h5>
    Supportability
</h5>
<p>
    When describing supportability requirements, you may want to specify:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Coding standards
    </li>
    <li>
        Naming conventions
    </li>
    <li>
        Class libraries
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintenance access
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintenance utilities
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    3. Capture constraints
</h4>
<p>
    In this step you document any design constraints on the system being built. In general terms,&nbsp;a constraint is a
    restriction on the degree of freedom we have in providing a solution [Dean Leffingwell and Don Widrig 2000. <i>Managing
    Software Requirements – a Unified Approach</i>. Addison Wesley Longman]. Design constraints represent design decisions
    that have been mandated and must be adhered to.
</p>
<p>
    The&nbsp;Constraints represent the '+' in "FURPS+" and&nbsp;can be further categorized, as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Design constraint</strong>: Specifies or constrains the options for architecting and/or&nbsp;designing a
        system. For example, requiring that a&nbsp;relational database be used for persistence.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Implementation constraint</strong>: Specifies or constrains the coding or construction of a system. For
        example, required standards, processes, tools, implementation languages, hardware platforms, operating systems,
        third-party components, class libraries, and resource limits (use of memory or disk space).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interface constraint</strong>: Specifies an external item with which a system must interact, or constraints
        on formats or other factors used within such an interaction.&nbsp; For example, interfacing with an external system
        via message queues.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Physical constraint</strong>: Specifies a physical constraint imposed on the hardware used to house the
        system - shape, size, or weight, for example.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending on the number of constraints to be documented for the system, you may want to provide sub-sections for each
    of the constraint types. Additionally:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If the requirements include the purchase of third-party components, be sure to document any applicable licensing or
        usage restrictions, and any associated compatibility/interoperability or interface standards. A separate section
        per purchased component is recommended.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the requirements include specific interface requirements, it is recommended that you provide separate sections
        for the different types of interfaces (e.g., user, hardware, software). For each interface, be sure to include
        adequate specificity, protocols, ports and logical addresses, and so forth, so that the software can be developed
        and verified against the interface requirements. Specifically: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                For user interfaces, describe the user interfaces that are to be implemented by the software.
            </li>
            <li>
                For hardware interfaces, include logical structure, physical addresses, expected behavior, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                For software interfaces include a description of the interfaces to other components of the software system.
                These may be purchased components, components reused from another application or components being developed
                for subsystems outside of the scope of this system, but with which this software application must interact.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    4. Capture compliance requirements
</h4>
<p>
    By compliance, we include standards compliance (including regulatory standards, coding standards or user interface
    style guides), as well as legal disclaimers, warranties, copyright notices, patent notice, wordmark, trademark, and/or
    logo compliance.
</p>
<p>
    Compliance requirements may be realized in terms of other requirements (functional, non-functional, and
    constraints).&nbsp; In such cases, the details of those requirements should be documented in the applicable sections of
    the Supplementary Specification as described in the earlier steps.&nbsp; However, it is important to summarize the
    standards and policies that a system must comply with.&nbsp; The resulting compliance requirements may refer to the
    applicable detailed requirements, as necessary.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the number of compliance requirements to be documented for the system, you may want to provide
    sub-sections for the different kinds of compliance affecting the system.
</p>
<p>
    The following sections provide some examples of the kids of information you might want to capture for different kinds
    of compliance:
</p>
<h5>
    Licensing Requirements
</h5>
<p>
    Define any licensing enforcement requirements or other usage restriction requirements that are to be exhibited by the
    software.
</p>
<h5>
    Legal, Copyright, and Other Notices
</h5>
<p>
    Describe any necessary legal disclaimers, warranties, copyright notices, patent notice, wordmark, trademark, or logo
    compliance issues for the software.
</p>
<h5>
    Applicable Standards
</h5>
<p>
    Describe (by reference) any applicable standards and the specific sections of any such standards that apply to the
    system being described. For example, this could include legal, quality and regulatory standards, industry standards for
    usability, interoperability, internationalization, operating system compliance, and so forth.
</p>
<h4>
    5. Capture documentation requirements
</h4>
<p>
    In this step, you describe the requirements, if any, for documentation. Documentation requirements may include
    requirements for online help, as well as and end-user documentation (e.g., installation guides, user's guides, training
    material, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Like compliance requirements, documentation requirements drive other types of requirements.&nbsp; Specifically
    functional requirements (the system must provide support functional access to the online help), as well as usability
    requirements (on demand access to system usage information supports the overall usability of the system).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Thus, like compliance requirements, detailed requirements supporting documentation requirements should be documented in
    the applicable sections of the Supplementary Specification as described in the earlier steps, but it is also important
    to document and summarize the overall documentation requirements for the system. The resulting requirements may refer
    to the applicable detailed requirements.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the number of documentation requirements to be documented for the system, you may want to provide
    sub-sections for the different kinds of documentation to be provided for the system.

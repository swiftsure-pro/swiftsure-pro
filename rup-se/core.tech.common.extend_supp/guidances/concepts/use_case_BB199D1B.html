    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    A use case describes the interactions between one of more&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/actor_411726C.html" guid="_zGqO0MDpEduTGJ8i4u8TMw">Actor</a>s and the system in order to provide an observable result of value for the
    initiating actor.
</p>
<p>
    The functionality of a system is defined by different use cases, each of which represents a specific goal (to obtain
    the observable result of value) for a particular actor.
</p>
<p>
    In an automated teller machine shown in Figure 1, the Bank Customer can withdraw cash from an account, transfer funds
    between accounts, or deposit funds to an account. These correspond to specific goals that the actor has in using the
    system.&nbsp;
</p><br />

    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Each use case is associated with a goal of one of the actors. The collection of use cases constitutes all the possible
    ways of using the system. You should be able to determine the goal of a use case simply by observing its name.
</p>
<p>
    A use case describes the interactions between the actor(s) and the system in the form of a dialog between the actor(s)
    and the system, structured as follows:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The actor &lt;&lt;does something&gt;&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        The system &lt;&lt;does something in response&gt;&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        The actor &lt;&lt;does something else&gt;&gt;
    </li>
    <li>
        The system ...
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Each dialog of this form is called a "Flow of Events".
</p>
<p>
    Because there are many flows of events possible for achieving the goal (for example, the flow may differ depending upon
    specific input from the actor), and there are situations in which the goal cannot be achieved (for example, a required
    network connection is currently unavailable), each use case will contain several flows, including one "Basic Flow of
    Events" and several "Alternative Flows".
</p>
<p>
    The Basic Flow of Events specifies the interactions between the actor(s) and the system for the ideal case, where
    everything goes as planned, and the actor's goal (the observable result of value) is met. The basic flow represents the
    main capability provided by the system for this use case.
</p>
<p>
    As the name implies, Alternative Flows specify alternative interactions associated with the same goal.
</p>
<p>
    Closely related to use cases is the concept of a scenario. A scenario is a <em><strong>specific</strong></em> flow of
    events, for a <em><strong>specific</strong></em> set of inputs to the system, states of the system, and states of the
    system's environment. Scenarios are closely related to test cases.
</p>
<h3>
    Properties of Use Cases
</h3>
<h4>
    <a id="Name" name="Name">Name</a>
</h4>
<p>
    Each use case should have a name that indicates what is achieved by its interaction with the actors. The name may have
    to be several words to be understood. Note: No two use cases can have the same name.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Brief Description" name="Brief Description">Brief Description</a>
</h4>
<p>
    The brief description of the use case should reflect its purpose.
</p>
<h4>
    Flow of Events
</h4>
<h5>
    <a id="Flow of Events - Contents" name="Flow of Events - Contents">Flow of Events - Contents</a>
</h5>
<p>
    The flow of events should describe the use case's flow of events clearly enough for an outsider to easily understand.
    Remember, the flow of events should represent <em>what</em> the system does, not <em>how</em> the system is design to
    perform the required behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Follow these guidelines for the contents of the flow of events:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Describe how the use case starts and ends.
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe what data is exchanged between the actor and the use case.
    </li>
    <li>
        Do not describe the details of the user interface, unless it is necessary to understand the behavior of the
        system.&nbsp;Specifying user interface details too early will limit design options.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe the flow of events, not only the functionality. To enforce this, start every action with "When the actor
        ... ".
    </li>
    <li>
        Describe only the events that belong to the use case, and not what happens in other use cases or outside of the
        system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid vague terminology.
    </li>
    <li>
        Detail the flow of events. Specify what happens when, for each action. Remember this text will be used to identify
        test cases.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you have used certain terms in other use cases, be sure to use the exact same terms in this use case, and
    that&nbsp;the meaning of the terms is consistent. To manage common terms, put them in a glossary.
</p>
<h5>
    <a id="Flow of Events - Structure" name="Flow of Events - Structure">Flow of Events - Structure</a>
</h5>
<p>
    The two main parts of the flow of events are <b>basic flow of events</b> and <b>alternative flows of events</b>. The
    basic flow of events should cover what "normally" happens when the use case is performed. The alternative flows of
    events cover behavior of optional or exceptional character in relation to the normal behavior, and also variations of
    the normal behavior. You can think of the alternative flows of events as detours from the basic flow of events, some of
    which will return to the basic flow of events and some of which will end the execution of the use case.
</p>
<p>
    The straight arrow in Figure 2 represents the basic flow of events, and the curves represent alternative paths in
    relation to the normal. Some alternative paths return to the basic flow of events, whereas others end the use case.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    Figure 2: Typical structure of a use case flow of events
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Both the basic and alternative flows should be further structured into steps or sub-flows. In doing this, your main
    goal should be readability of the text. A&nbsp;guideline is that a sub-flow should be a segment of behavior within the
    use case that has a clear purpose, and is "atomic" in the sense that you do either all or none of the actions
    described.
</p>
<h4 class="picturetext">
    <a id="Special Requirements" name="Special Requirements">Special Requirements</a>
</h4>
<p>
    In the Special Requirements of a use case, you describe all the requirements associated with&nbsp;the use case that are
    not covered by the flow of events. These are non-functional requirements that will influence the design. See also the
    discussion on non-functional requirements in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../core.tech.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/requirements_8006414F.html" guid="_0Wh-sMlgEdmt3adZL5Dmdw">Concept: Requirements</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="preconditions and Postconditions" name="preconditions and Postconditions">Preconditions and Post-conditions</a>
</h4>
<p>
    A <strong>precondition</strong> is the state of the system and its&nbsp;environment that is required before the use
    case can be started.&nbsp;Post-Conditions are&nbsp;the states the system can be in after the use case has ended. It can
    be&nbsp;helpful to use the&nbsp;concepts of <b>precondition</b> and <b>post-condition</b> to clarify how the flow of
    events starts and ends. However, only use them only if the audience for the description of the use case agrees that it
    is helpful. Figure 3 shows an example.

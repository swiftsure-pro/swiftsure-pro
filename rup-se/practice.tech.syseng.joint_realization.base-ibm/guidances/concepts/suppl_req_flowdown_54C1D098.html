    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    As a part of the Analysis process, the Architect develops an initial Locality diagram. The Locality view is a synthesis
    of the non-functional considerations and provides a context for addressing how the non-functional requirements such as
    reliability and capacity are addressed.
</p>
<p>
    Standard engineering practice allows for the budgeting of capacity, permitted failure rates, and so forth. This effort
    results in a set of derived supplementary requirements for each locality element. The locality characteristics are
    determined from these requirements. The derived requirements and characteristics are revisited as the partitioning of
    subsystems (across localities) is determined and refined.
</p>
<p>
    The system-level Supplementary Requirements also have an impact on the subsystems (hardware, software, people)
    themselves, with the subsystem characteristics, in combination with locality characteristics, combining to yield the
    desired system characteristics.
</p>
<h3>
    Quality of service measures
</h3>
<p>
    Quality of service (QoS) is a notion that includes aspects of non-functional requirements. The list of such
    characteristics is potentially large, including many "abilities," such as reliability, maintainability and usability,
    and possibly complete engineering specialties such as safety, human factors, and so on. Significant engineering
    specialty problems are typically addressed by experts in those disciplines. The issues that often fall to the system
    and software engineer are those to do with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Performance - how well, against time, does the system perform its functions, that is, responsiveness, throughput,
        meeting deadlines.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reliability/Fault Tolerance - how long can the system continue to perform its required functions before a failure,
        and how well (gracefully) does it cope with partial failures. The system Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) is a
        measure of reliability.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintainability - how easy is it to keep the system running, and diagnose and fix problems in the system. The
        system Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) is a measure of maintainability.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Before system construction, the system engineer must often rely on models of the system as a way of defining
    alternative solutions, and assignment and budgeting of non-functional requirements. These models are analyzed to see
    how well they meet the desired quality of service levels, and a solution can then be selected (usually with cost as a
    factor). Such <i>trade studies</i> are important in system design at all levels of refinement. The synthesis of
    candidate solutions depends very much on the ability and experience of the Architect. The analysis of these solutions
    (through mathematical modeling, simulation, and so on) should be relatively mechanical. Even so, the reliability of
    these analyses will vary considerably with the goodness of the input data and the fidelity of the models.
</p>
<p>
    A body of techniques is available to make tractable the analysis of models with respect to the QoS measures listed
    above - for example, Rate Monotonic Analysis&nbsp; for the examination of the performance of real-time embedded
    software systems [see Klein, M. H., et al. <i>A Practitioners' Handbook for Real-Time Analysis: Guide to Rate Monotonic
    Analysis for Real-Time Systems,</i> Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1993], and Failure Mode Effects and Criticality
    Analysis (FMECA), for hardware failure and safety risk identification and characterization [see Kececioglu, Dimitri,
    <i>Reliability Engineering Handbook, Vol. 2,</i>&nbsp; <font color="#000000">PTR Prentice Hall</font>, 1991].
</p>
<p>
    Support for these kinds of analyses is being added to the UML through the provision of profiles, notably the <i>"UML
    Profile for Scheduleability, Performance, and Time Specification"</i> and the <i>"UML Profile for Modeling Quality of
    Service and Fault Tolerance Characteristics and Mechanisms."</i> These profiles (available from <a href="http://www.omg.org/" target="_blank"><u><font color="#0000ff">www.omg.org</font></u></a>) define annotations for
    UML models that allow them to be analyzed for the characteristics defined in the profile, and quantitative predictions
    made regarding these characteristics, using various existing and future model analysis techniques and tools.

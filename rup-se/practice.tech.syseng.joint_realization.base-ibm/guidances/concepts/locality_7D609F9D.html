    In <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../practice.tech.syseng.joint_realization.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/sys_arch_viewpoints_67437C6A.html" guid="_UZvWwL6MEd6EnZQdp87-CQ">System Architecture: Viewpoints, Levels, Models</a>, you find the idea of
    <i>viewpoints</i> from which a system can be examined; of particular relevance here is the <i>physical</i> viewpoint.
    This viewpoint "focuses on the distributed interactions between objects in the system, and provides the mechanisms to
    support distribution" [quote from <i>Architecting with RM-ODP</i>, Janis Putman, Prentice Hall PTR]. At the level
    described here, the logical objects include subsystem instances. The Deployment Model supports this viewpoint by
    describing how the system is physically distributed and the physical support for distributed interactions between the
    logical objects supported by the system.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of&nbsp;a Deployment Model&nbsp;is to capture the decomposition of the system into elements which host the
    processing. This is done at several levels of abstraction, namely Locality (the most abstract), Descriptor, and
    Implementation (the least abstract, at which actual choices of hardware and software are described)- these levels are
    more or less equivalent to the Conceptual, Specification and Physical levels described for the&nbsp;Deployment
    Model&nbsp;(which is used&nbsp;mostly in&nbsp;software development). The most familiar manifestation of the&nbsp;a
    deployment model is at the Design and Implementation levels, through the use of UML deployment diagrams. The following
    is an introduction to the Analysis level, physical viewpoint concept of <i>Locality.</i>
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Localities and Connections" name="Localities and Connections">Localities and connections</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The <b>Locality</b> Model represents the initial, abstract, <i>physical</i> partitioning and distribution of the
    system, and is concerned with the physical resources of the system (nodes, devices, sensors and their physical
    connections and interfaces, and the physical characteristics of these, for example weight, heat generation, power
    consumption, vibration, and so on). A locality expresses notionally where processing occurs (the semantics of locality
    implies a tighter grouping of resources) without defining exact geographic location or how the processing capability is
    to be realized. It is conceivable for very complex, very large systems, that the initial Locality Model might have
    localities that decompose to finer-grained localities (just as a subsystem might contain subsystems). At the
    <b>Descriptor</b> level, the <i>types</i> of processing resources at a locality are specified - these are <i>nodes</i>,
    which can include computing devices (servers, workstations, and so on), people, or other electro-mechanical devices.
    Finally, at the <b>Implementation</b> level, the actual hardware selection is made, numbers of role instances (in the
    case of human resources) determined, with a defined set of configurations, capacity, power and other environmental
    requirements, cost and performance. For example, a Locality view might show that the system enables processing onboard
    a space satellite and a ground station. Other examples are shown in the figures in the Locality Diagrams section.
</p>
<p>
    The Deployment Model is also used to record the subsystem operations that are hosted at each locality - this determines
    the computing requirements to be supported at the locality. Based on the behavior to be supported at the localities,
    collaborations of localities can be constructed (and represented in interaction diagrams)- these help characterize the
    connections between the localities.
</p>
<p>
    The locality diagrams show the initial partitioning, how the system processing elements are distributed, and how they
    are connected. Locality of computing is an issue when considering primarily non-functional requirements and for many
    systems engineers, this is "the architecture."
</p>
<p>
    Locality diagrams consist of two elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Locality - a locality is a collection of computing, storage, structural, electro-mechanical and human resources
        that can host processing (in the general sense) and/or interact physically with the environment and other
        localities.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connections - pathways for information, mass, energy, or discrete physical items to be exchanged between
        localities.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The semantics of the locality diagrams are similar to those of deployment diagrams, and localities are represented as
    stereotyped UML nodes. In the UML standard, a node is a classifier that "... is a physical object that represents a
    processing resource, generally, having at least a memory and often processing capability as well. Nodes include
    computing devices but also human resources or mechanical processing resources." UML allows us to extend the semantics
    of nodes, and the associations that connect them, through stereotyping and the application of tagged values, and these
    facilities are used to define localities and connections. The icon for a locality is a rounded cube (see the
    illustrations in&nbsp;the Locality Diagrams section).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Each locality in the Deployment Model needs an attached description of derived supplementary requirements (derived from
    the supplementary specifications) which specify quality (reliability, maintainability, safety, and so on), physical and
    environmental requirements, and development constraints (cost, technical risk, and so forth). From these requirements,
    the actual characteristics (of each locality) are determined; obviously these are chosen to meet the explicit
    requirements at least, but can exceed the requirements if sound engineering practice dictates this - for example, to
    cope with unexpected capacity demands.
</p>
<p>
    Localities are characterized with:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Quality tags, such as reliability, availability, performance, capacity, and so forth.
    </li>
    <li>
        Management tags, such as cost and technical risk
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Connections are characterized by the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Link parameters, such as data rate, supported protocols, physical flow rate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Management tags, such as cost and technical risk.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As you move to the design model, localities can be refined to one or more nodes, or more than one locality can be
    mapped to a single node. And, through the freedom given by the UML definition, localities can represent quite disparate
    things, ultimately realized, for example, as a collection of hardware platforms, part of a computational resource, or
    groups of collaborating human resources.

</h3>
<p>
    The figures show Locality diagrams that document different engineering approaches to a click-and-mortar enterprise. The
    enterprise has a number of retail stores, central warehouses, and a web presence. In the first solution, there is
    processing capability in the stores. In the second solution, all the terminals are connected directly to a central
    office processor. In each case, characteristics can be set for the localities that are required to realize the design.
    These days, most people would agree that the first example is a better design. However, the solution in the second
    example might become superior in a few years.

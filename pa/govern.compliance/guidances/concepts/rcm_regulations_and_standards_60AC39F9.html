    Most regulations are nondirective. That means that, while the regulation tells you what you need to do, it does not
    tell you how to do it.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, in the United States, requires that CEOs attest to the accuracy of
    quarterly and annual financial statements. But what does “accuracy” really mean? How far do companies have to go to
    verify that their financial statements are truthful and accurate? How can they demonstrate that? Here are a few
    examples:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Revenue was accounted for properly
    </li>
    <li>
        Only authorized personnel had access to financial applications
    </li>
    <li>
        All changes to financial applications were made in a secure and controlled environment
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Organizations fail audits because their financial applications were improperly managed. Yet what does a “properly
    managed” financial application look like?
</p>
<p>
    Organizations adopt governance frameworks, such as ITIL, CMMI, and COBIT, to help answer these questions. These
    frameworks provide guidance in the form of an independent, accredited yardstick by which organizations can implement
    common measurement and control mechanisms to document compliance. A high degree of commonality exists across all of
    these standards. For example, there are common control mechanisms that govern the completeness, accuracy, validity,
    authorization, and segregation of duties with respect to software applications.

</p>
<p>
    The specific framework chosen is less important than the fact that the choice is documented and compliance against the
    framework is actively managed. In practice,&nbsp;large organizations implement a mix of these frameworks, drawing from
    ITIL and COBIT, for example. There is often&nbsp;a layering of&nbsp;these frameworks also. For example, organizations
    may adopt ITIL (the IT Infrastructure Library) to govern their operations environment, COBIT (Control Objectives for
    Information and Related Technology) to manage their IT governance efforts, and CMMI (the Capability Maturity Model
    Implementation) to govern their software development organization.

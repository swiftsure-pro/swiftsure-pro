    The deployment aspects of the IBM Rational Software Delivery Platform process solution provide the ability to securely
    deploy a release.
</p>
<p>
    The IT Operations Team requires the ability to build applications, and securely move the build from the development
    environment to QA to Production, while providing traceability from production back into development. The primary goal
    is to bridge the gap between software builds and deployments.
</p>
<p>
    Using the IBM Rational Configuration and Change Management Solution with Tivoli Configuration Manager to distribute
    software can help automate, streamline, and accelerate the software build and deploy process.
</p>
<p>
    The table below highlights some of the key aspects required, and shows how the Tivoli Configuration Manager aligns with
    these needs.

     IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager Features
</h4>
<p>
    Tivoli Configuration Manager provides Software Package Blocks, or reusable deployment scripts. These can be used to
    create a solution to install a software component or patch that is reusable across all systems. Ultimately, reusable
    stored skills reduce error rates.
</p>
<p>
    Tivoli Configuration Manager automates processes and best practices by linking scripts together in a workflow (with
    logic included). This improves operational efficiency and reduces human errors. Automated management is implemented by
    using reference models that automatically remediate systems to ensure compliance to defined standards. This reduces
    operational activity, enforces standards, and reduces deployment time.
</p>
<p>
    Tivoli Configuration Manager also has the ability to implement <i>No Touch</i> OS Pristine installs. It does this by
    leveraging Microsoft Automatic Deployment Services and Remote Installation Services technologies to perform the actual
    installation process on the bare-metal, for both Microsoft desktop installations and Microsoft server installations. It
    can also drive other tools like imaging products directly, or tools provided by vendors for Linux and UNIX systems.
    This reduces cost and improves productivity, as there is no need to have physical access to the Server to start the
    installation.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, Tivoli Configuration Manager supports pervasive devices. This provides integrated support for PalmOS,
    PocketPC, and Nokia Communicator devices. You can update the configuration information and software on these devices
    using the same tools with which you manage desktops and servers. This enables you to gain control over the increasing
    number of pervasive devices being used for business applications across the enterprise. The administrators do not need
    to learn to use a separate, specialized tool for managing pervasive devices.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the additional capabilities of Tivoli Configuration Manager (that may have limited applicability to Compliance)
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Multicasting Software</b>: This provides the ability to reduce distribution time, which is independent of the
        number of targets. Software packages are only sent across the network once, and this can significantly reduce
        network bandwidth usage. This can help in an environment where there are slow speed links between locations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enterprise Directory Support</b>: You can now leverage organizational information stored in enterprise
        directories in order to determine a set of targets for a software distribution or an inventory scan. The
        subscribers to a reference model can be set based on a directory query. This allows software distribution and
        inventory operations to be targeted by user. Administrators can store information about users in a single location.

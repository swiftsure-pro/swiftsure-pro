    The work products to be controlled are those that have an impact on the effectiveness of the aspects of the process
    subject to compliance management. They must have controls applied to them in order to ensure and demonstrate that all
    affected parties can work from the same official (approved) and current versions of information, and that processes are
    used in a consistent and repeatable fashion.
</p>
<h4>
    Controlled work product properties
</h4>
<p>
    The following list identifies the basic, minimum requirements that controlled work products must have:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Prior to issue, the work product must be approved by the designated approver in order to confirm its adequacy for
        use (the approval often automatically results in the issue). The designated work product approver(s) cannot be the
        work product author(s).
    </li>
    <li>
        Work product status (such as <em>draft</em>, <em>current</em>, <em>obsolete</em>, or <em>archive</em>) must be
        shown.
    </li>
    <li>
        Work product must specify the name of the designated owner and author.
    </li>
    <li>
        The history of significant work product changes must be summarized and identified.
    </li>
    <li>
        The current revision status must be shown by including a unique version label, incremental version number, or the
        date issued.
    </li>
    <li>
        Suitable identification must be applied to obsolete work product if it is retained for any purpose.<br />
         For example: "the work product is archived for customer support purposes"
    </li>
    <li>
        Work product, in its approved form, cannot contain strikeouts, review comments, or unresolved issues (resolution
        can be to not consider issue until a later stage in the project).
    </li>
    <li>
        Work product must be legible, readily identifiable, complete, and easily retrievable.
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Attachments:
</h5>
<p>
    When a controlled product is defined within a tool as an object with an attachment for its contents, the attachment
    must include the following:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        A statement that describes where the work product control information is stored. For example,
    </li>
    <li>
        The title of the work product or a work product identifier.
    </li>
    <li>
        A disclaimer, similar to the one below, should be included to let work product users know they are responsible for
        confirming use of the current, approved version of any controlled work product:
    </li>
</ol>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p>
        <em>"The official version of this work product is stored online. Any hard copy versions of this work product are
        for REFERENCE ONLY.</em> <em>Users of this work product are personally responsible for using the official version,
        and for verifying that any copies are complete and of the official version."</em>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    Controlled work product management guidelines
</h4>
<h5>
    General guidelines
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        For work product review and approval records, electronic signatures are the equivalent of handwritten signatures.
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes that are cosmetic in nature (such as correcting grammar, formatting, spelling errors, or work product links
        or URLs) do not require reapproval. Minor changes that do not change the work product meaning or content require no
        reapproval as well.
    </li>
    <li>
        The current, approved versions of work products should be available for use wherever needed.
    </li>
    <li>
        All controlled work products must be catalogued through an official list (for example, the list of work product
        approval records defined in the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_record_control_specification_CCEFEA04.html" guid="_sEd0cJfWEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Record Control Specification</a>).
    </li>
    <li>
        Any work products in use having an external (non-project) origin must be identified to ensure that current versions
        are used and, for copyrighted work products, their distribution controlled.
    </li>
    <li>
        The use of any obsolete work products must be prevented, unless intended.
    </li>
    <li>
        For forms, templates, checklists, and schedules, the control required is only a unique version label, version
        number, or revision date.
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Which work products to control:
</h5>
<p>
    The general guideline is to strongly consider control a work product if it:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Is required to produce the offering
    </li>
    <li>
        Is used by multiple people who all need to work from the same level of information or procedure
    </li>
    <li>
        Contains key or vital business, offering, or customer information
    </li>
    <li>
        Significantly influences the quality of the offering
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following list identifies the types of work products that must be strongly considered for control:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Method and process elements
    </li>
    <li>
        Guidance
    </li>
    <li>
        Plans and schedules
    </li>
    <li>
        Designs, specifications, and requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Operations manuals
    </li>
    <li>
        Internal standards
    </li>
    <li>
        External documents (such as standards, copyrighted or legal documents, or customer-supplied documents)
    </li>
    <li>
        Contracts or other formal agreements
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Work product review and approval
</h5>
<p>
    The control of work product should be based on the workflow defined in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/capabilitypatterns/rcm_develop_controlled_work_product_4A2DAF36.html" guid="_rpRBYZqjEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Capability Pattern: Develop a Controlled Work Product</a> and analyzed in <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/rcm_mapping_rasci_model_to_uma_for_work_product_control_46929A9.html" guid="_o3D6AJ6JEduMOPYypke8PA">Mapping the RASCI Model to UMA for Work Product Control</a>. In addition to identifying
    the key Approving role, this workflow describes how other roles support the approval process in a way consistent with
    separation of concerns. In addition, the approval process is subject to the following guidelines.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Work product approval denotes that the designated approver(s) has read, understands and agrees with the content of
        the controlled work product or has taken appropriate action (e.g. mandate reviews) to ascertain its quality.
        Controlled work products can be approved with or without comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        Requests for work product reviews and/or approvals must clearly identify the work product to be reviewed and/or
        approved.
    </li>
    <li>
        For electronic reviews and approvals of controlled work products, the records of work product review and/or
        approval must contain the complete user id of the required reviewer(s) and/or designated approver(s), and the date
        and time stamp of their review and/or approval.
    </li>
    <li>
        For hardcopy reviews and approvals of controlled work products, the records of work product review and/or approval
        must contains the reviewer(s) and/or designated approver(s) wet-ink signature and the date of their signature.
    </li>
    <li>
        In a case of work product approval or review without comments and/concerns, the approver's or reviewer's response
        is usually deemed sufficient. While helpful, other supporting information (such as the basis for the approval) is
        usually not required. No form of response is required from optional reviewers.

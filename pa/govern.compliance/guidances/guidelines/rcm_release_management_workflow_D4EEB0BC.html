    Overview
</h3>
<p>
    The diagram below provides an abstraction of the Release Management workflow from the IBM Tivoli Unified Process
    methodology. This overview shows the "big picture" of the complete release management process to which the project team
    interfaces.
</p>
<p>
    The project team needs to interface closely with this team early in the lifecycle to feed into the release planning
    activities. The release management team needs to feel confident in the changes being made to the application, and will
    plan these changes into a specific release. Later in the project lifecycle, the final baseline and build will be
    delivered to this team to become part of the larger software release package.

<h3>
    Activities
</h3>
<ul class="text-normal">
    <li>
        <span class="bold"><a id="pr" name="pr"></a><strong>Plan Release</strong></span> 
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                After an RFC has been approved, it may be sent to release management to be built, tested, and deployed as
                part of a release. Some RFCs will already correspond to a release, but in other cases this activity will
                determine the composition of a release from multiple RFCs.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this activity, a schedule is created for building, testing, and deploying the release. This is called
                the Release Plan. In addition, a high-level draft Release Test Plan is created.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="bold"><a id="dbr" name="dbr"></a><strong>Design and Build Release</strong></span> 
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                Subsequent to planning the release, this activity determines what you need to build for the release, and
                how you will assemble and deploy it. This may involve some rework to the Release Plan. During this
                activity, you will design the release build, installation, and rollback scripts at a high-level. In
                addition, you will obtain software and hardware components for the build activity, and put the test
                environment in place.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you have designed the release, this activity builds the scripts and other aspects needed to install
                and deploy the release. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Creating the build environment
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating build, install, and rollback scripts
                </li>
                <li>
                    Placing software in the DSL
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating support, training, and deployment documentation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Updating the CMDB with information about the release package
                </li>
                <li>
                    Initiating the procurement of hardware and software needed for deployment
                </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="bold"><a id="ar" name="ar"></a><strong>Accept Release</strong></span> 
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                This activity takes a completed <em>release package</em> and tests it to determine if installation,
                configuration, and rollback work properly. If successful, the release is ready for rollout. If not, the
                release must go through another round of either design or build, and subsequent retesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                After testing, the release package is either accepted or rejected. If it is rejected, the rework goes
                through change management. If accepted, work progresses to the Plan Release Rollout activity.
            </p>

        <span class="bold"><a id="prr" name="prr"></a><strong>Plan Release Rollout</strong></span> 
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                In this activity, the details concerning specifically what will be done during rollout are generated. This
                includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Detailed sequence of events
                </li>
                <li>
                    Identification of the CIs installed, changed, and removed

        <span class="bold"><a id="cptr" name="cptr"></a><strong>Communicate, Prepare, and Train for Release</strong></span>
        
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                You must not roll out releases without sufficiently preparing stakeholders, support staff, and users. In
                this activity, these individuals are informed about the release and how to make use of the deployed
                release.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Notifications about the upcoming rollout are sent to all those affected.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Support staff are given training to handle incidents and requests related to the release.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Release documentation and -- where provided -- training is also made available to users.

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                The rollout of a Release Package is performed in this activity. The Release Package is deployed to all CIs
                identified in the Rollout Plan. The Release Package is deployed as provided, without any modifications.
                After distribution, installation, and configuration, the changes are checked to ensure their functional
                integrity. This may involve automated checks, user surveys, or other approaches. If the implementation
                fails to meet acceptance criteria, then the back-out plan is carried out.
            </p>
            <p>
                The CMDB is updated to reflect the fact that specific RFCs have been deployed. A subsequent review of the
                related RFCs is performed by the change management process.

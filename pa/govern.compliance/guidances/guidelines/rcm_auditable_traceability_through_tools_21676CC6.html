    There are many motivations for traceability. The one we focus on here is the chain of work products that connects
    requirements to tests, and demonstrates their satisfaction in the product.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Why Traceability?</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Organizations live in a complex environment. Changes in legislation and policy affect how an organization must operate.
    Organizations must be able to respond to changes in the environment or risk failure. To pass compliance audits, they
    must be able to provide evidence -- in the form of audit trails -- demonstrating that action was actually taken
    according to process. This enables an organization to show how it has responded to a change in the environment.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="346" src="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/resources/traceabilityPicture.gif" width="668" />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Process automation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Handling traceability manually is possible, but it usually equates to a cumbersome, expensive process that negatively
    impacts the ability of an organization to respond to change. Healthy organizations respond rapidly and effectively;
    they adapt well to changes in the environment. Unhealthy organizations respond poorly to change; they are slow to
    adapt, and adaptation is a difficult process.
</p>
<p>
    If response to change is mostly manual, response will be slow and difficult. If response to change is automated, the
    organization will have the ability to respond to change more rapidly and effectively.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="197" src="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/resources/processAutomation.gif" width="372" />
</p>
<p>
    Automating change presents an opportunity to transform your business into an adaptive business.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Automate the generation of audit documentation
    </li>
    <li>
        Ensure that audit reports and audit trails are in place for the software development organization
    </li>
    <li>
        Automate enforcement of your compliant process
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide process guidance, automated workflows, and tool-directed behavior
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Compliance management implies audits, audits imply traceability, and traceability can be a tremendous headache. IBM
    Rational brand tools help facilitate compliance management by automating processes and providing traceability.

<h3>
    <strong>Traceability with IBM tools</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    IBM Rational tools provide traceability through the whole compliance management lifecycle. You can document
    <em><strong>corporate compliance policies</strong></em> in RequisitePro, and show how policies are traced to
    initiatives that allow you to comply with those policies.
</p>
<p>
    You can model the systems as they currently exist, and as they are going to be built, with IBM&reg; Rational&reg; Software
    Architect. You can trace from requirements in RequisitePro to designs in Rational Software Architect. You can control
    your development processes in ClearQuest, and establish traceability requests for system changes to the implementation
    and testing of changes, again in ClearQuest. You can document changes as you build the system with IBM&reg; Rational&reg; Build
    Forge&trade;, and control changes to the pieces of the system through ClearCase. This page concentrates on the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>RequisitePro</strong> to document traceability from requirements and design to implementation
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>ClearQuest and ClearQuest test management</strong> to provide traceability between requirements, test
        artifacts, test reports, and defects<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    RequisitePro Traceability
</h3>
<p>
    The ability to keep track of relationships between requirements is an important aspect of any mature development
    organization. Not only is traceability a sign of maturity, it is usually a requirement for compliance management. It is
    required in many real-time safety critical systems (for example, medical systems, air traffic control systems, and
    others). RequisitePro enables requirements traceability through an easy-to-use interface. In RequisitePro, you can
    specify the requirements of a system, and show how those requirements are fulfilled through its traceability features.
</p>
<p>
    A typical grouping scenario is to group business requirements and Corporate Policies into a requirement type,
    high-level Compliance Requirements into another, and more detailed application or process requirements (such as
    software specs) into yet another type. Here is how it is done in Requisite Pro:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use the <strong>Requirement Types</strong> tab in the Project Properties dialog box to define the properties of the
        requirement type.
    </li>
    <li>
        To access the <strong>Requirement Types</strong> tab, right-click the project icon in the RequisitePro Explorer and
        choose <strong>Properties</strong>. (If security is enabled, you must have project structure permission to create a
        requirement type.)
    </li>
    <li>
        To add a Requirement Type to RequisitePro, access the Project Properties dialog box by clicking <strong>File &gt;
        Project Administration &gt; Properties &gt; Requirement Types &gt; Add</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once you enter a variety of requirements of different types into RequisitePro, you can trace between them. Traceability
    is a bi-directional dependency relationship (a link) between two related requirement types. When you create
    traceability relationships, RequisitePro visually indicates a dependency between the two requirements. With this
    information, you can perform real-time impact analysis as requirements change. This knowledge helps you to manage
    project scope and resource allocation. Specifically, traceability helps to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ensure that all high-level stakeholder needs and features are addressed by analyzing requirements coverage
    </li>
    <li>
        Eliminate unnecessary detail-level requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Explain the impact of changes. When you make changes to one requirement, you can visually identify the potential
        impact to linked requirements.<br />
         To use traceability effectively, document a traceability model in the Requirements Management Plan. When you
        define a traceability model, you should always define the traceability relationship in one direction.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Do not confuse traceability relationships (between requirement types) with hierarchical
    (parent/child) relationships. Hierarchical relationships detail requirements. Traceability relationships show how
    requirements are related to each other.
</p>
<p>
    In RequisitePro, you can view traceability information in the View workplace through an Attribute Matrix, Traceability
    Matrix, or Traceability Tree. The visual representation of traceability links is visible only in the Traceability
    Matrix or Traceability Tree. An Attribute Matrix view can show this information textually in the "Traced-to" and
    "Traced-from" attributes.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>The ClearQuest-RequisitePro Integration</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    RequisitePro and ClearQuest work together to provide full lifecycle traceability between requirements for a system and
    its testing. You do this by linking Requirements in RequisitePro to test artifacts in ClearQuest. Likewise, you can
    plan, develop, and then execute tests using ClearQuest test management. If a test fails, enter a defect against the
    requirement from ClearQuest test management. A defect containing a reference to the requirement being tested will be
    created. Finally, you can produce an audit report that includes the requirement, the test result, and the defect
    produced.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="350" src="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/resources/reqProCqInteg.gif" width="538" />
</p>
<p>
    ClearQuest links to RequisitePro, IBM Rational Manual Tester, IBM Rational Functional Tester, and IBM Rational
    Performance Tester. ClearQuest also integrates with IBM Rational Software Architect and IBM Rational Software
    Modeler.<br />
     It is a single product for lifecycle traceability and provides links between the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Requirement &gt; Test Case
    </li>
    <li>
        Defect &gt; Test Case
    </li>
    <li>
        Test Case &gt; Test Script/Source<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In ClearQuest, the Test Manager view presents test assets in a hierarchy. It includes a <strong>Planning</strong> and
    <strong>Execution</strong> tab. Each has a specific role:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <strong>Planning</strong> tab creates and maintains the hierarchy for ClearQuest test management records.
    </li>
    <li>
        The <strong>Execution</strong> tab executes configured test cases and test suites, and reviews test results
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    ClearQuest test management organizes your Test Plans, Test Cases, and Configured Test Cases hierarchically as shown
    below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Test Plans
    </li>
    <li>
        Test Cases
    </li>
    <li>
        Configured Test Cases
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="center">
    <img height="283" src="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/resources/CqtmModel.gif" width="657" />
</p>
<p>
    <em>Use the Requirements tab to define test inputs (ClearQuest requirements) for specific Test Cases. This step is the
    most important step for compliance management, because it establishes the link between the requirement and the test
    case (see below for more details)</em>.<br />
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Rational Administrator</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    The Rational Administrator feature integrates ClearQuest and RequisitePro. You can create a RequisitePro project and a
    ClearQuest database, and link them together with the RequisitePro and ClearQuest Integration wizard. This integration
    allows you to link requirements to test artifacts, and to provide traceability between them.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="310" src="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/resources/RatAdminCqReqproInteg.gif" width="572" />
</p>
<p>
    The relationship between ClearQuest test management and RequisitePro is established by associating a requirement to a
    test case. This step is critical for demonstrating traceability from requirements to their tests.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Lifecycle requirements traceability is the key to documenting compliance implementation
    </li>
    <li>
        Are all the compliance requirements accurately captured and implemented in key applications?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To associate a requirement to a test case, click the <strong>Requirements</strong> tab in the test case editor. Select
    the RequisitePro project for this system. Log in to RequisitePro and pick a requirement to associate to the test case.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="409" src="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/resources/traceTestCase2Req.gif" width="516" />
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Defects</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    After a configured test case record is executed and the test results are committed using a ClearQuest Client, you can
    use any ClearQuest client to associate a defect record with the Test Log record. To create defects in ClearQuest:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        From the Test Log associated with the executed configured test case, click the <strong>Generated Defects</strong>
        tab
    </li>
    <li>
        Click <strong>Add</strong> to add a reference to an existing defect<br />
         You can also click <strong>New</strong> to create a defect that will be associated with the Test Log
    </li>
    <li>
        &gt;Use the Browse Record Type window to locate the defect that you want to associate with the test execution, and
        then click <strong>OK</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Save your changes for the Test Log<br />
         The <strong>Test Log</strong> tab of the associated defect is updated to display the associated Test Log</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <em>Audit Reporting</em>
</h3>
<p>
    <em>The final step in creating an auditable traceability from requirements through the testing of those requirements is
    to create an audit report. This can be done using Rational SoDA. A sample audit report appears below. It shows
    requirements, change requests, and defects associated with the requirements.</em>

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    A key aspect of achieving <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/compliant_493255E7.html" guid="_EzSAAKgcEduvgNw8YDVZiQ">Compliant</a> status is to create confidence that internal and external policies,
    regulations, and standards are being implemented within the development process, and across its work products. In
    practice, <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/supportingmaterials/rcm_compliance_concerns_1F199D6A.html" guid="_iuC5IMl5Edq73Lte-PIrLQ">Typical Compliance Concerns</a> and <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/supportingmaterials/rcm_common_compliance_challenges_DC3191CD.html" guid="_GYId4PuJEdqd86I-vfQ0Jw">Common Compliance Challenges</a> can be addressed by providing legitimate evidence of
    their implementation to an impartial third party, also known as an auditor. A process where such evidence is produced,
    maintained, and readily available is designated as "auditable".
</p>
<p>
    <strong>This roadmap identifies a set of process control enhancements that strengthen the auditability of the IBM
    Rational Unified Process (RUP) methodology.</strong> These controls help provide two fundamental compliance related
    benefits:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Provide a large step up towards achieving organizational compliance to today's leading standards and regulations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make the implementation of <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/application_controls_CE95A4E.html" guid="_qSypoCcTEduzgcDanUOYTw">Application Control</a> (covered in the <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/roadmaps/rcm_application_control_development_5FFAFF12.html" guid="_wdqFcJfaEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Application Controls Development</a>) auditable, and therefore make this aspect of
        compliance management easier to assess.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exec">
    Executive Summary
</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    Effective Compliance Management can be achieved by demonstrating the implementation of IT Controls in an organization.
    The appropriate scope of these controls is an organization-specific decision. RUP for Compliance Management
    demonstrates the addition of fundamental IT Process Controls to the RUP methodology. Their primary purpose is to help
    extend the applicability of RUP processes from high-trust environments to environments where enhanced security,
    auditability, and process control are required:
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>
    The additions we made to the RUP process to enhance control are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Capture of Compliance Management information in separate work products</strong> to facilitate the audit
        process<br />
         Evidence: The RMC process specification itself
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Definition of Compliance Management roles</strong> that support <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/separation_of_duties_8C2BA36D.html" guid="__dmKALG5EduQg98MaW53eA">Separation of Duties</a><br />
         Evidence: The RMC process specification itself
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Formal Work Product Control</strong><br />
         Evidence: <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_approval_A90E5C0B.html" guid="_zB-cQJFLEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Approval</a>s specified and required for all controlled work products
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Record Control</strong>: Demonstration of the process implementation requires identifying reports, audit
        trails, electronic signatures, and other development artifacts that provide physical evidence of compliance
        throughout the project, and are show-cased at key lifecycle checkpoints.<br />
         Evidence: <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_record_control_specification_CCEFEA04.html" guid="_sEd0cJfWEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Record Control Specification</a> along with individual <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_record_771C6FEA.html" guid="_SNrxsJFJEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Record</a>s
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Traceability of tests to requirements</strong> supported by test results that demonstrate satisfaction of
        software requirements prior to release<br />
         Evidence: <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementlink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{87374880-B351-4822-8C1E-819ECA9F51D4}">Test Results</a> linked to requirements use cases
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Formal gating</strong> of software delivery implemented through the "Three Points of Control for Software
        Delivery" schema<br />
         Evidence: The Process Validation Plan that documents that the <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/rcm_three_points_of_control_A5D1EF0D.html" guid="_mGUj4Ml2Edq73Lte-PIrLQ">Three Points of Control</a> schema meets control objectives. Once this is
        established, all that is left to do is to document the fact that the process utilizes the "Three Points of Control
        for Software Delivery" schema.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Formally Specified Process</strong> based on the RUP methodology, particularly suited to the support of
        compliance-oriented controls, and supported by <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/tool_directed_behavior_3469F542.html" guid="_51jbcEQ0EduBm87UK6h94Q">Tool Directed Behavior</a><br />
         Evidence: Audit trails captured by software asset management tools
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This roadmap outlines how the above controls are implemented here and can be used to enhance general auditability of
    the RUP process. A separate add-on roadmap introduces additions to this roadmap for the auditable implementation of
    Application Controls. These controls may need to be further enhanced to meet the standards set up for a specific
    development process.

<h2 id="proc">
    Process enhancements
</h2>
<h3 id="wp">
    Compliance Management work products
</h3>
<p>
    The work products described below have been added to RUP to support auditable process control. These work products have
    been designed as sub-artifacts of existing RUP artifacts whose purpose is to:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Facilitate audits by separating what is relevant to compliance management
    </li>
    <li>
        Limit the review and approval burden by restricting it to the aspects of the process that are relevant to
        compliance management
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    There are two categories of compliance management work products. <strong>process work products</strong>, which describe
    compliance aspects of the process being followed, and <strong>project data</strong>, which describes project-specific
    data created as a result of executing the process.
</p>
<h4>
    Process work products

    <font face="Helv" size="2">This roadmap assumes that the process has already been enhanced to address the content of
    these work products. They are:</font>

<p>
    <strong>Note</strong> that these process work products have been separately identified for audit and approval purposes:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            We recommend that the work products, roles, and tasks for these work products be implemented into the process
            itself with Rational Method Composer. Creating these work products, and maintaining them consistently with
            their Rational Method Composer representation, is part of a separate workflow not yet included in this plug-in.
        </li>
        <li>
            This roadmap assumes that the published configuration documents the process and makes reference to the separate
            auditable documents as needed. This is why these process work products are not inputs to any of the tasks in
            the process.
        </li>
        <li>
            This plug-in contains an implementation in Rational Method Composer of the "Three Points of Control" control
            point specification, and approvals that are considered important for auditable processes. It also includes the
            document form of the <a href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/rcm_three_points_of_control_A5D1EF0D.html" guid="_mGUj4Ml2Edq73Lte-PIrLQ">Three Points of Control</a> control point specification. Only templates are

<p>
    The following work products must be developed or revised with each project. They are:
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_record_control_specification_CCEFEA04.html" guid="_sEd0cJfWEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Record Control Specification</a> lists all the work products identified as records, as
    well as how they are produced, stored, and managed. It may be modified, because certain records prescribed by the
    process may not be applicable in a particular implementation. While the record types specified in the process will not
    change, the ones produced for a particular project and their contents may require customization.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_distribution_policy_287E8103.html" guid="_N0bgULtfEdqP_9jYUYvJlA">Distribution Policy</a> defines the policy for distributing deliverables to QA or to
    Deployment. It describes the exit criteria and procedures to be satisfied for the release to be authorized. It is the
    responsibility of the Release Manager.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_work_product_approval_85A74A6F.html" guid="_7-27AMBCEdq13pUCu1XB9Q">Work Product Approval</a>: Approvals are key to a disciplined, auditable process. An
    approval is a formal record of one or more work products being signed off as acceptable. Many approvals are defined
    within the RUP methodology today as a step within a task. In RUP for Compliance Management, we specify approvals as
    separate work products to underline their importance. Each one is defined as the outcome of a new task, which makes it
    possible to specify the approver (role responsible for the task), the work product approved (input to the task), and to
    attach a checklist to the task to enumerate approval criteria. Work products subject to approval are designated as
    controlled work products.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_project_archive_EFE55C64.html" guid="_Fw0DcKWkEduMOez3RZ4bIQ">Project Archive</a> provides a baseline of all relevant project artifacts, both for

    that might be needed for maintenance.
</p>
<h3 id="roles">
    Key roles
</h3>
<p>
    Role-based separation of duties is a fundamental tenet of the compliance domain. Its foundation is that development,
    review, approval, and use of artifacts cannot be carried out by the same individual, as otherwise the impartiality of
    the process can be called into question. RUP roles have thus been expanded and refined based on the <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/raci_model_8C0A7463.html" guid="_BWDSUKBUEduMOPYypke8PA">RACI Model</a> (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) to support this principle
    in the development of work products. Compliance Management expands and refines RUP roles in part because of the new
    work products introduced, but also to address separation of duties in compliance-sensitive areas.
</p>
<h4>
    Compliance Management roles
</h4>
<p>
    <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/roles/rcm_release_manager_35D37EEC.html" guid="_JfVykMBFEdq13pUCu1XB9Q">Release Manager</a>: Defines the Distribution Policy. This role is responsible for
    collating the released work products from multiple sub-projects, and for producing a release that can be delivered into
    the production environment. This role owns the release management process, and has authority for the overall process
    results. Finally, The release manager is responsible for the quality of the process of assembling the release, and for
    ensuring that all criteria specified in the Distribution Policy were met.
</p>
<h4>
    Compliance related roles
</h4>
<p>
    These roles are roles involved in normal software development whose responsibilities have been expanded to include
    compliance related activities.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/roles/rcm_technical_lead_E7489E2.html" guid="_yVehwLtnEdqP_9jYUYvJlA">Technical Lead</a>: A senior designer or implementer for a subsystem or component. This
    role has both technical and some managerial responsibilities, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Guiding and overseeing the development of application software components
    </li>
    <li>
        Approving code changes
    </li>
    <li>
        Making sure that change requests are implemented
    </li>
    <li>
        Assigning work
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This plug-in introduces this role specifically to address approvals. This role will eventually
    be moved into the base RUP methodology to deal with larger team structures where work assignment and status reporting
    is delegated through technical leads.

    but is adjusted here because of the greater need of separation of duties between release management and deployment. In
    this plug-in, the role remains substantially similar to the existing definition, but it is primarily focused on the
    end-game (namely, delivering the software release into the production environment). To address the additional workload,
    responsibilities, and the separation of duties between managing its creation and approving its field deployment, the
    role of Release Manager (defined above) was created to assist with all release management tasks, and to assume
    distribution responsibilities.

<p>
    <font color="#000000">This control identifies which work products must be approved, and contains an auditable workflow

<h4>
    Traceability
</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    In the most highly-regulated situations, <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/traceability_B39BC7C5.html" guid="_o5yXgKhFEduvgNw8YDVZiQ">Traceability</a> can take on a life of its own and encompass the bulk of the work
    products produced by the process. Here, we have kept it to the (minimum) level of maintaining traceability between
    change requests and associated tests (see <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/rcm_auditable_traceability_through_tools_21676CC6.html" guid="_XnuPQKhEEduvgNw8YDVZiQ">Implementing Auditable traceability with Tools</a>). To formalize this control, change
    requests, tests, and test logs have been designated as <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/controlled_work_product_C1582C06.html" guid="_l2aQQKzeEdupW5-1VA4drg">Controlled Work Product</a>s.
</p>
<h4>
    Formally gated process (Control Points)
</h4>
<p>
    Control Points are formal process gates (or milestones) that require a certain number of conditions to be achieved, and
    at which the health of the project can be assessed. <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_control_point_B6DD26C1.html" guid="_LooxgJFjEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Control Point</a>s were implemented as a special kind of approval that addresses the health of the <strong>project</strong> in
    its area of focus, instead of assessing the quality of specific work product(s).
</p>
<p>
    Defining points of control is very much organization- and situation-dependent, and determining which ones to include
    may be project-dependent. In general, we recommend considering making all major process milestones control points. We
    have not done so here, but have focused instead on managing builds and creating releases, where control is most likely
    to prevent costly errors.
</p>
<p>
    The "<a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/rcm_three_points_of_control_A5D1EF0D.html" guid="_mGUj4Ml2Edq73Lte-PIrLQ">Three Points of Control</a>" approach defines a controlled process for producing builds
    and delivering software. It embodies good Release Management Practices akin to <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/rcm_release_management_workflow_D4EEB0BC.html" guid="_xk71QMw0EdqV26RhCpjg4g">The Release Management Workflow from IBM's Tivoli Unified Process</a>.

<h4>
    A formal RUP-based process
</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    The RUP methodology is a comprehensive, formally specified software development process. Its integration with other
    Rational tools (such as Rational Portfolio Manager) makes it possible to export relevant aspects of the method, thus
    supporting process automation and tool-directed behavior.
</p>
<p>
    <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/tool_directed_behavior_3469F542.html" guid="_51jbcEQ0EduBm87UK6h94Q">Tool Directed Behavior</a> is highly dependent on the capabilities of the tools
    selected. Because an entirely manual process is error prone and often prohibitively expensive, Tool Directed Behavior
    is indispensable to make the process manageable. How much is implemented depends on an organization's budget for tools
    and its need for automation. The tools presented below are the ones used in RUP for Compliance Management.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Rational Method Composer</strong> allows customers either to tailor the RUP methodology or to capture their own
    processes in a manageable, configurable, and publishable standard structure. This structure is an implementation of the
    Unified Method Architecture (UMA) based on the Object Management Group (OMG) standard SPEM2.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>RequisitePro</strong> supports the ability to initiate a <a href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/compliance_enhancement_project_CC6CE62C.html" guid="___7jMCjOEduDTNuGskDd4A">Compliance Enhancement Project</a> by capturing compliance requirements with appropriate
    levels of traceability and control.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>ClearQuest</strong> provides the ability to deliver an auditable change by supporting management and control of
    software assets through workflow automation. Automated workflow management can help enforce processes, audit trails,
    traceability, electronic signatures, and reporting, all of which allow organizations to document authorizations and
    signoffs at key stages in the lifecycle.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>ClearCase</strong> provides the ability to deliver an auditable change by supporting management and control of
    software assets through version control, audit trails and traceability, user authentication, baselines, and reporting.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tivoli Configuration Manager</strong> helps automate, streamline, and accelerate the software build and deploy
    process.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Rational Portfolio Manager</strong> helps business executives and IT leadership align IT investments with
    business goals. It helps project teams efficiently plan and execute projects. It also provides a collaborative workflow
    environment for project and asset management, insight into resource capacity planning, and oversight of project
    financials.
</p>
<h2 id="dp">
    Software development process
</h2>
<p>
    This roadmap describes how the above controls are integrated into the RUP methodology, but it does not address changing
    the process substantially. While compliance management does involve making changes to IT processes, significant method
    changes must be avoided while the process is being used. This is due to the confusion and methodological irregularities
    that mixing process changes and process usage may often cause. The only acceptable process adjustments are
    project-specific customizations already covered in the RUP platform with the development case. The process outlined
    below focuses on using RUP with enhanced auditability as provided by the plug-in.
</p>
<p>
    To further simplify this roadmap, the topic covering how to handle compliance requirements was also moved to a
    supplemental roadmap, to be used as an add-on to this one.
</p>
<p>
    The typical lifecycle supported by this roadmap involves two major releases or distributions: One for beta testing,
    which occurs at the end of construction, and one for final release, which occurs at the end of transition.
</p>
<h3 id="inception">
    Inception Phase tasks
</h3>
<p>
    During the Inception Phase, the Process Engineer works alongside the Change Manager to ensure that the development
    process includes the right controls, as required by corporate policy. The Compliance Analyst refines the compliance
    management requirements (and their traceability), while the Project Manager works to ensure that these requirements are
    introduced in the planning activities. When a compliance enhancement project starts, the following has already
    happened:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Regulations have been interpreted and transformed into corporate policies
    </li>
    <li>
        The organizational process for conducting enhancement projects has been defined accordingly
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Therefore, these tasks are mainly intended to adapt the existing organizational process (this plug-in focuses on the
    RUP platform) to the tools and specifics of the project at hand, and to verify that the result is satisfactory. The
    tasks incorporated into the standard RUP Inception Phase include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Develop Development Case will be extended beyond customizing the process as prescribed by the standard RUP
        methodology: the artifacts describing Work Product Control, Record Control, and the composition of the archive will
        be reviewed and customized according to project needs.
    </li>
    <li>
        The task <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_validate_development_process_E1565209.html" guid="_HXgGMLx9EdqBmd-rQHpwqA">Validate the development process</a> will be performed to confirm the workability of
        the process, and to validate the use of the tools automating the process. <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_process_validation_approval_42BC2F59.html" guid="_H7a9MLttEdqP_9jYUYvJlA">Process Validation Approval</a> will consist of approving the test logs, thus
        verifying that the process conforms to the compliance requirements on which it is based. This task will only be
        performed after the development case has been finalized. While revisions of the development case are not common
        after the Inception Phase, any revision of the development case must trigger a subsequent execution of these tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_define_distribution_policy_6BE43015.html" guid="_WUgNwLrMEdq_f-xxmjgMWA">Define Distribution Policy</a>: The Release Manager defines the distribution policy
        for the software to be released.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the end of this phase, the following objectives should have been met:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A clear definition of the project's software scope, clarifying the requirements that will be included and
        satisfied, and detailing the boundary conditions (including an operational vision, acceptance criteria, and what is
        intended to be in the product and what is not)
    </li>
    <li>
        Concurrence among all project stakeholders regarding what the requirements are, and how the software application
        will be amended to meet these requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        Identification of any critical scenarios that will drive any design tradeoffs within the architecture
    </li>
    <li>
        Estimation of the overall cost and schedule for the entire compliance enhancement project (and more detailed
        estimates for the elaboration phase)
    </li>
    <li>
        Estimation of the potential risks (sources of unpredictability)
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elaboration">
    Elaboration Phase tasks
</h3>
<p>
    During the Elaboration Phase, the Architect begins to work on the critical scenarios that will have an impact on the
    architecture. The Implementer translates the design specification into the software product. The Tester defines tests
    to validate that changes introduced in this phase are working successfully.
</p>
<p>
    The standard RUP Elaboration tasks are applied in this phase. The context is that the requirements driving the
    architecture (being designed and implemented) are related to compliance requirements.
</p>
<p>
    The additional tasks incorporated into the standard RUP Elaboration phase are predominantly related to approving
    artifacts:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementlink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{1CD358DF-3FFC-4281-B3EF-8E3CD76C5900}">Review Change Requests</a><br />
         The purpose of this task is to determine if the Change Request (CR) should be accepted or flagged for rejection.
        For compliance purposes, this acts as an approval point, producing a <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_change_request_approval_22513B89.html" guid="_rWAuYLosEdqks_xlfprPXQ">Change Request Approval</a> alongside the resulting CR.

    <li>
        <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_approve_delivered_changes_5A58C50C.html" guid="_TmCnwLqdEdq_f-xxmjgMWA">Approve Delivered Changes</a><br />
         When the Implementers deliver their changes, the Technical Lead approves the changes and their delivery into the
        integration stream.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_approve_susbsystem_baseline_FD79A248.html" guid="_AWWCcLrOEdq_f-xxmjgMWA">Approve Subsystem Baseline</a><br />
         Periodically, subsystem baselines will be taken. The Technical Lead approves this baseline to ensure control over
        the baseline being used by the development team.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_approve_baseline_96D94D8B.html" guid="_ieyLIMd2EdqNELG7PFkTng">Approve Baseline</a><br />
         This task is closely coupled with <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementlink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{9139A97B-D458-490D-A9D5-CDBB86968475}">Promote
        Baselines</a>. The Release Manager (with the help of the System Integrator) approves this baseline to ensure
        control over the promotion of a set of build objects into the QA or Production environment.<br />
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    At the end of this phase, all requirements should be stable, any architectural concerns should be resolved, and the
    chosen approach to introducing <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/it_process_controls_E11DAB89.html" guid="_lgZt4Bt8Eduf9ZX4AMC3mg">IT Process Controls</a> should be proven in both the application and within the process.
</p>
<h3 id="construction">
    Construction Phase tasks
</h3>
<p>
    During the Construction Phase, the Implementer continues to add functionality into the software product or application.
    The Tester executes tests to validate that the functionality introduced in this phase is working successfully.
</p>
<p>
    The standard RUP Construction tasks are applied in this phase. The context is that the requirements being designed and
    implemented are related to compliance management.
</p>
<p>
    The same review and approval tasks performed in the elaboration phase (<img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementlink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{1CD358DF-3FFC-4281-B3EF-8E3CD76C5900}">Review

</p>
<p>
    Towards the end of this phase, the <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_distribute_software_release_D8B38723.html" guid="_kXfnYLrMEdq_f-xxmjgMWA">Distribute Software Release</a> hands off the entire release to QA for System Testing.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of this phase, all requirements have been fully explored and the development of the system is complete based
    upon the baselined architecture. The release is ready for beta testing in preparation for final release into the
    production environment.
</p>
<h3 id="transition">
    Transition Phase tasks
</h3>
<p>
    The focus of the Transition Phase is to ensure that the software application is available for its end users. It
    includes testing the product in preparation for release, and making minor adjustments based on user feedback. The key
    aspects for compliance are the final build of the application, acceptance testing, and the controlled transition into
    release management and production.
</p>
<p>
    The standard RUP Transition tasks are applied in this phase. The context is that the requirements being designed and
    implemented are related to compliance management.
</p>
<p>
    Final review and approval tasks performed in the previous phases (<img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementlink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{1CD358DF-3FFC-4281-B3EF-8E3CD76C5900}">Review

However, at this point in the process, only minor changes
    are expected to occur.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, the following final approval and distribution tasks are preformed during this phase. They are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_sign_off_successful_tests_4B8290E0.html" guid="_Si4zwLrAEdq_f-xxmjgMWA">Sign off successful tests</a>: This task occurs at the end of acceptance testing
        under the responsibility of the test manager
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the baseline is approved, if the application is distributed, the deployment tasks listed below are carried out
        by the release management team. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a class="elementlink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_approve_product_distribution_DE9C384F.html" guid="_v7LtALrMEdq_f-xxmjgMWA">Approve Product Distribution</a>: The deployment manager provides formal

                the Release Manager to address field (as opposed to organizational) issues.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

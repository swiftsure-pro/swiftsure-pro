<h3>
    An Introduction to RASCI
</h3>
<p>
    The <b>RASCI model</b> (sometimes RACI) is a simple approach to characterizing roles and responsibilities for
    performing development activities.
</p>
<p>
    <b>RASCI</b> stands for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>R</b> = <b>Responsible:</b> Tasked with the overall completion and correctness of the activity (usually the lead
        or the owner for the problem or project)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>A</b> = <b>Accountable:</b> Identifies the role to whom "R" is accountable (usually the role authorized to
        approve the work)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>S = Supportive:</strong> Provides resources to, or can play a supporting role for, "R" in producing the
        result (usually a developer)
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>C</strong> = <b>Consulted:</b> Has information and competencies needed to assess the work (usually a SME or
        technical stakeholder)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>I</b> = <b>Informed:</b> To be notified of results only (usually other workers affected by the contents of what
        is produced)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    RASCI is supported by a <b>technique</b> supported by a <b>RACI matrix or RACI chart</b>. This chart is a simple table
    where rows are activities or processes, and columns represent roles involved in these activities. at the intersection
    the letters R, A, S, C, I (or nothing) are to be placed depending on the involvement of the role in the activity.
    Developing a RACI matrix supports method building by fostering communication and encouraging discussion about roles and
    their involvement in the organization's activities. The process followed in building the matrix is:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Identify all of the activities</b> of concern, and list them down the left hand side of the matrix.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Identify all of the roles</b> involved, and list them along the top of the matrix.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Complete the cells of the matrix by <b>identifying who has the R, A, S, C, I (or no involvement) for each
            activity</b>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Every activity should have one and only one “R” and only one "A"</b>. A gap occurs for each activity with no
            “R” (no role is responsible), and an overlap occurs when multiple roles exist that have an “R” or an "A" for a
            given activity.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Resolve Overlaps:</b> Overlaps usually indicates that the activity is not granular enough or not well-enough
            understood. The answer is therefore that you need to further study and detail its structure to separate out the
            individual responsibilities.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            <b>Resolve Gaps:</b> Gaps mean that either a role is missing from the matrix or a responsibility of a role has
            been overlooked. The individual with the authority for defining roles must determine which existing role is
            responsible, or if a new role is required.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>
    Simple Application of RASCI to Work Product Development
</h3>
<p>
    The rich RASCI characterization facilitates the identification of the roles needed to conduct work product development
    in a controlled environment. It can support the following important process properties:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Assigning responsibilities to the right role
    </li>
    <li>
        Achieving separation of roles and thereby contributing to <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/separation_of_duties_8C2BA36D.html" guid="__dmKALG5EduQg98MaW53eA">Separation of Duties</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The activity "Develop Controlled Work Product", which is central to compliance management, can thus be represented
    generically by the following RASCI matrix as it involves all of the RASCI roles:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="RASCI Matrix for the Develop Controlled Work Product activity" src="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/./resources/RACI.gif" />
</p><br />
<p>
    Responsible1, Accountable1, and so on are placeholders for the organization's roles you would select for the
    corresponding responsibilities, depending on the kind of work product you envision developing. Note, however, that the
    RASCI model does not capture the work products produced, and thus cannot model work-product ownership.
</p>
<h3>
    Using UMA to model and expand the RASCI model
</h3>
<p>
    UMA offers a characterization of roles that can be used successfully in modeling the RASCI model. It consists of:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Role <strong>responsible</strong> <strong>for a Work product</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Role <strong>responsible for unfolding a Task</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Role <strong>participating in executing a Task</strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    To Map these to the RASCI roles effectively, you first observe that the purpose of the "develop controlled work
    product" activity is to produce several work products (the work product itself, review comments, and eventually the
    approval for the work product). This typically involve the following 4 key tasks:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Develop Work Product</strong> produces the initial version of the work product
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Conduct Review</strong> produces review comments
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Address Review Comments</strong> updates the work product according to review comments
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Approve Work Product</strong> produces an Approval Record
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    . The workflow for these tasks is described in the generic <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/capabilitypatterns/rcm_develop_controlled_work_product_4A2DAF36.html" guid="_rpRBYZqjEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Capability Pattern: Develop a Controlled Work Product</a> task, whose purpose is to
    provide an auditable workflow for work product development. The mapping of the RASCI model to UMA causes an expansion
    of the scope of the RASCI model to include both activities and work products. This is desirable because there are many
    situations where work products must be viewed independently of the process that produces them. In such situations, it
    is important to determine who owns these work products.
</p>
<p>
    Roles are mapped as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Responsible1</strong> is mapped to the technical authority responsible for developing, and for conducting
        the review of, the work product. This role is tasked with producing the review record summarizing both the issues
        raised during the review, and the requirements for their resolution.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Supportive1</strong>, when present, designates the role(s) in charge of developing the work product (under
        the technical supervision of <strong>Responsible1</strong>). The presence of <strong>Supportive1</strong> is very
        beneficial to role separation, as <strong>Responsible1</strong> can thus remain in charge of assessing results
        without creating a conflict of interest. When <strong>Supportive1</strong> is not allocated,
        <strong>Responsible1</strong> develops the work product. In such situations, <strong>Approver1</strong> must
        therefore be careful to ascertain with <strong>Consulted1</strong> that the review and follow-up activities were
        thorough and impartial.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Approver1,</strong> the approver, is both responsible for the approval task and the associated record.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consulted1</strong> is mapped to the <em>set of reviewers</em> for the work product who will participate in
        the review task. Reviewers can be involved before the document is put up for review, but their presence in the
        review is evidence of their involvement
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Informed1</strong> is the members of "To List" of the approval record, who are thus made aware of the
        production of a new work product; they are modeled as participants in the approval task. Clearly,
        <strong>Informed1</strong> should be a superset of <strong>Consulted1</strong>, because those who are consulted
        must also be informed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    This mapping is summarized in the table below, which in addition provides two example assignments of individuals to the
    RASCI roles.

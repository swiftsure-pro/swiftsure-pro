    When asked the question, “Do you operate in a regulated industry?” many businesses will respond with a resounding “No.”
    However, the reality is that nearly all businesses operating in the United States and abroad are directly or indirectly
    influenced by government regulations. For example, in the United States, all businesses must comply with Occupational
    Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) regulations. In Europe, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work
    (EASHW) provides similar regulations. Generally, it is very likely that any business operating in a country with a
    structured form of government is subject to one or more regulations.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <span lang="EN-US">Recognition of whether a business is considered regulated&nbsp;or not more often has to do with the
    impact that the regulations have on&nbsp;the bottom line than whether the regulations exist. As regulations become part
    of standard operating procedures within an industry, the impact of these regulations is easily overlooked. For example,
    if you walk through a mall or restaurant in the U.S. around closing time,&nbsp;you may notice&nbsp;a familiar “Wet
    Floor” warning sign. Although these signs originated in response to OSHA regulations, today they are typically regarded
    as a standard operating procedure and a cost of doing business.</span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    Different business domains pose different&nbsp;levels of risk to the general population. Situations that pose risks to
    life and limb are regulated differently than situations that do not. Where risk is higher, regulations tend to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Set higher bars for compliance and, usually, mean associated higher cost of implementation
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal">
            Demand a&nbsp;stricter standard of accountability and stiffer penalties, when applicable
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    Regulations often share the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal">
            <strong>Mandatory:</strong> Regulatory authorities&nbsp;may require qualification and adherence to specific
            standards, and they may dictate explicit penalties for noncompliance.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal">
            <strong>Nondirective</strong><b>:</b> While regulators typically define <i>what</i> needs to be done, they do
            not always detail the <i>how</i>: The specific steps that companies must take to ensure compliance. The
            interpretation of regulations into specific policies and operating procedures can be left to organizations and
            their legal and policy-making staffs.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal">
            <strong>Continuously changing</strong><b>:</b> Regulations, their interpretation, and their embodiment in
            corporate policies can change frequently and at inconvenient times. Commonly accepted standards for meeting
            regulatory requirements evolve as regulations are tested and their interpretations refined in courts of law.
            Also, regulatory authorities themselves are malleable. For example, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
            of the United States developed guidance governing the implementation of&nbsp;the Title 21-Part 11 Electronic
            Records and Signatures Rule, guidance was developed and revoked four times before the agency settled on a final
            direction.

    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal">
            <strong>Increasing IT impact</strong><b>:</b> While few apply directly to IT, regulations increasingly affect
            IT systems.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal">
            <strong>Non-certifiable:</strong> Agencies generally do not approve, recommend, or validate particular
            solutions. Most agencies will not certify that any particular solution guarantees compliance.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal">
            <strong>Related to risk</strong><b>:</b> Many regulatory agencies acknowledge that a compliance management
            approach based on examining every detail&nbsp;can be&nbsp;prohibitively expensive. These
            agencies&nbsp;recommend a risk-based approach to compliance management: This approach is based on performing a
            thorough assessment of the risks involved in the business and demonstrating that the these risks are being
            addressed adequately. This allows an organization to establish business controls and conduct internal audits
            based on the risks identified. As a result, the&nbsp;business processes&nbsp;associated with the greatest
            degree of risk of noncompliance are the ones managed most proactively.<br class="MsoNormal" />

    Introduction
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>This roadmap supplements the main software delivery roadmap</strong> in situations where a release includes
    Application Controls (requirements specific to compliance management). The additional activities involve creating the
    compliance-related work products, and subsequently verifying that the compliance requirements were met in a controlled
    fashion. To get the most out of this roadmap, it is strongly recommended as a pre-requisite that you read and
    understand the main software delivery roadmap.
</p>
<h2 id="proc">
    Process enhancements
</h2>
<h3 id="wp">
    Compliance Management work products
</h3>
<p>
    The major addition covered by this roadmap results from the addition of a new controlled work product called <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_compliance_requirements_AE5D086D.html" guid="_CbpqIJfdEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Compliance Requirements</a>. These are Application Controls whose purpose is to enhance
    The ability of IT organizations to achieve compliance. Compliance Requirements constitute a subset of all project
    artifacts, and it is added to the responsibilities of the requirements specifier. This artifact creates the need to
    introduce the following additional work products:
</p>
<p>
    <a href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_corporate_compliance_policy_97E9C45A.html" guid="_KJGdkLosEdqks_xlfprPXQ">Corporate Compliance Policy</a> -- This work product provides the organization's
    interpretation of the standards and regulations to which the organization is subject. It is necessary because
    regulations are often non-directive: While they tell you <strong>what</strong> you need to achieve, they don't tell you
    <strong>how</strong> to do it. It is developed by the Policy Analyst. Developing this artifact, however, is outside the
    scope of this plug-in. It is only used here as an input.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_compliance_vision_addendum_BAC7DF51.html" guid="_G0mxcMwIEdqWwYk_OOw-vg">Compliance Enhancement Vision Addendum</a> is a sub-artifact of the vision document that
    focuses on the aspects of the project intended to improve the control and auditability of the software development
    process. This artifact is a high-level outline of the compliance requirements, techniques, metrics (and so on) that are
    considered in the project, and it summarizes the approach for validating that the process meets these control
    objectives.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_compliance_vision_addendum_BAC7DF51.html" guid="_G0mxcMwIEdqWwYk_OOw-vg">Compliance Test Plan</a> is a sub-artifact of the Test Plan that focuses on verifying
    that compliance requirements have been met.
</p>
<h4>
    Work product control
</h4>
<p>
    The following additional approvals are now required, thereby making the associated artifacts controlled work products.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_compliance_vision_addendum_approval_2D1E810B.html" guid="_Znx-AMkSEdq9CtL8HKjkzA">Compliance Vision Addendum Approval</a> formalizes the validity of the approach
        being taken to manage compliance for the application or software product under development. It is the
        responsibility of the Compliance Analyst.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_compliance_requirements_approval_E5736688.html" guid="_YuD70LosEdqks_xlfprPXQ">Compliance Requirements Approval</a> formalizes agreement regarding the compliance
        requirements that will be incorporated into the application or software product. It is the responsibility of the
        Policy Analyst.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/workproducts/rcm_test_plan_approval_7F360C73.html" guid="_yz6-ILnvEdqLnMDVAL9PSw">Test Plan Approval for Compliance</a> formalizes that the project has appropriate
        test plans in place to verify the compliance requirements.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="roles">
    Key roles
</h3>
<p>
    Compliance Management introduces new roles, in part because of the new work products introduced, but also to address
    the separation of duties.
</p>
<h4>
    Compliance Management roles
</h4>
<p>
    <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/roles/rcm_compliance_analyst_7F19B87B.html" guid="_DrOjUJGVEdu6LZdnjUXiFA">Role: Compliance Analyst</a> — Defines corporate Compliance Policy and captures
    compliance requirements (after cataloging and interpreting regulations, standards, and policies to identify internal
    policies that allow the business to be compliant). Creates traceability between the compliance requirements, the
    internal policies, and the appropriate regulations, standards, and policies.
</p>
<h4>
    Compliance related Roles
</h4>
<p>
    <b>Requirements Specifier</b> — existing RUP role who details the compliance requirements, establishes priorities, and
    defines workflow around the "in scope" requirements.
</p>
<h2 id="dp">
    Software Development process
</h2>
<p>
    This process is an extension of the base process wherein additional activities take place to address the development of
    compliance software requirements (a.k.a. <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/application_controls_CE95A4E.html" guid="_qSypoCcTEduzgcDanUOYTw">Term Definition: Application Control</a>)
</p>
<h3 id="inception">
    Inception Phase tasks
</h3>
<p>
    The two new tasks in the Inception Phase are those needed to develop compliance requirements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_formulate_compliance_vision_A472EA5B.html" guid="_LAabIKtSEduodbWm-CGeMQ">Formulate Compliance Vision</a><br />
         <font color="#000000">The Compliance Analyst</font> produces a detailed outline of the compliance management
        requirements that will be incorporated during the project, and highlights the compliance-related goals within the
        project.
    </li>
    <li>
        <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{A1FA1E95-8028-42EB-9B92-0DA77380F3E1}">Task: Detail the Software Requirements</a> -- This task is a
        contribution to the RUP detail requirements task, with a focus on defining compliance requirements with the
        participation of the Compliance Analyst
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are a number of approvals introduced in the Inception Phase designed to ensure that the compliance requirements
    will be met. These include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_approve_compliance_approach_6DAFD0E0.html" guid="_pPnD8MkREdq9CtL8HKjkzA">Approve Compliance Approach</a><br />
         This task is closely coupled with the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_formulate_compliance_vision_A472EA5B.html" guid="_LAabIKtSEduodbWm-CGeMQ">Formulate Compliance Vision</a>. The purpose of this approval is to verify that the
        core compliance stakeholders accept the approach being used to incorporate compliance enhancements into the
        application. This will include acceptance of the compliance requirements in scope for the project, and their time
        line for delivery. The Compliance Analyst has authority for this approval.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/tasks/rcm_approve_test_approach_C114ACF2.html" guid="_F3oekLq_Edq_f-xxmjgMWA">Approve Test Approach</a><br />
         This task is closely coupled with <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{023FEC1B-5AA4-462B-A2FE-B92827E00BAB}">Agree on the Mission</a>. It provides a formal approval of the test
        plan designed to validate that the compliance management requirements have been included and satisfied. This
        approval is less formal, and is often approved internally to the team by the Test Manager.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="elaboration">
    Elaboration Phase Tasks
</h3>
<p>
    During the Elaboration Phase, the Architect begins to work on the critical scenarios that will have an impact on the
    architecture. The Implementer translates the design specification into the software product or application to automate
    <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/it_process_controls_E11DAB89.html" guid="_lgZt4Bt8Eduf9ZX4AMC3mg">IT Process Controls</a> required for compliance. The Tester will define tests to
    validate that the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/it_process_controls_E11DAB89.html" guid="_lgZt4Bt8Eduf9ZX4AMC3mg">IT Process Controls</a> introduced in this phase are working successfully.
</p>
<p>
    This phase is virtually identical to that of the main roadmap except that the compliance requirements will potentially
    be revised and hence re-approved in each iteration.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of this phase, the compliance requirements should be stable, any architectural concerns should be resolved,
    and the chosen approach to introducing <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/it_process_controls_E11DAB89.html" guid="_lgZt4Bt8Eduf9ZX4AMC3mg">IT Process Controls</a> should be proven in both the application and within the process.
</p>
<h3 id="construction">
    Construction Phase Tasks
</h3>
<p>
    This phase is conducted according to the main software delivery roadmap without changes.
</p>
<h3 id="transition">
    Transition Phase Tasks
</h3>
<p>
    This phase is conducted according to the main software delivery roadmap with added focus on final testing and
    deployment of the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/application_controls_CE95A4E.html" guid="_qSypoCcTEduzgcDanUOYTw">Application Control</a> into the production environment.

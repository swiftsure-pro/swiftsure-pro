    Process Conformance
</h4>
<p>
    This is one of the greatest challenges in most organizations today. As companies seek to find more and more streamlined
    methods for operation, the reasons for some business controls can get lost over time. Although significant
    documentation describing standard procedures and sign off exists in most organizations, it is more often viewed as
    unnecessary bureaucracy rather than protections for the business and its employees.
</p>
<p>
    The list below provides some common challenges currently observed in organizations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Processes are documented but are insufficiently adhered to
    </li>
    <li>
        Different organizations or departments make up their own procedures
    </li>
    <li>
        It is difficult to locate signoffs
    </li>
    <li>
        It is difficult to locate the latest versions of key work products (requirements and designs, and changes that
        correlate with them)
    </li>
    <li>
        It is often impossible to identify the versions in force in earlier releases
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Through the implementation of automated requirement management (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/toolmentors/rcm_reqpro_for_compliance_24F12A03.html" guid="_AymlMNrOEdqsdK980WQzog">Tool Mentor: Requisite Pro for Compliance</a>) and workflow automation (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/toolmentors/rcm_cq_for_compliance_70C79483.html" guid="_3WWooNqKEdqsdK980WQzog">Tool Mentor: ClearQuest for Compliance</a>), an organization can protect itself from
    lackluster controls or circumvention. This is what we call <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/tool_directed_behavior_3469F542.html" guid="_51jbcEQ0EduBm87UK6h94Q">Tool Directed Behavior</a> .
</p>
<p>
    Workflow automation has additional benefits beyond ensuring that workflow is adhered to. Tool Directed Behavior ensures
    that appropriate authorization points are not bypassed; it can then be used to demonstrate to <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/auditor_6FFD610C.html" guid="_R7Or4C5FEduN7qO2ExZVpQ">Auditor</a>s and others that certain tasks were actually started or completed as a
    result of what is documented.
</p>
<h4>
    Auditable Configuration Management and Change Control
</h4>
<p>
    In typical software development environments, there are many examples of regressions in production, and the possibility
    of inadvertent releases of non-production quality code. The list below provides some common challenges that are seen in
    organizations today.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Inability to manage multiple concurrent releases, deployments, and platforms simultaneously with high quality
    </li>
    <li>
        Inconsistent change control procedures, with the team using multiple processes and likely multiple tools
    </li>
    <li>
        Inability to change control file system structures
    </li>
    <li>
        Absence of integration between IT Operations and Development
    </li>
    <li>
        Inability to prove what code versions were deployed into production
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In environments subject to regulations and external standards, this is in general unacceptable and can be just cause
    for accusations of negligence or fraud.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, "industrial strength" <strong><em>configuration management procedures</em></strong> and processes (that
    is, types of IT Controls) must be implemented to protect the interests of all of the stakeholders. These stakeholders
    can include product or service consumers, senior executives or managers accountable for business controls, or
    shareholders of a publicly traded company.
</p>
<p>
    At the heart of it all is the need to demonstrate due diligence in the design, development, testing, and handling of
    the application assets that implement <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/termdefinitions/application_controls_CE95A4E.html" guid="_qSypoCcTEduzgcDanUOYTw">Application Control</a> for the company.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, in order to demonstrate due diligence and control over Application Controls, you must show appropriate
    <strong><em>configuration management and change control</em></strong> (as illustrated in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/toolmentors/rcm_cq_for_compliance_70C79483.html" guid="_3WWooNqKEdqsdK980WQzog">Tool Mentor: ClearQuest for Compliance</a> and <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/toolmentors/rcm_cc_for_compliance_6A2D90DB.html" guid="_PC0LgPuIEdqd86I-vfQ0Jw">Tool Mentor: Compliance Management in ClearCase</a>) over all of the assets used in the
    implementation of a business's automated systems.
</p>
<p>
    Note that while version control is important (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/toolmentors/rcm_cc_for_compliance_6A2D90DB.html" guid="_PC0LgPuIEdqd86I-vfQ0Jw">Tool Mentor: Compliance Management in ClearCase</a>), it is not enough to address the
    above challenges. Version control simply implements a librarian function against code, which can help in locating a
    problem after it has occurred. Appropriate integrated change management and configuration management processes are
    designed to reduce or eliminate the possibility that such catastrophes occur in the first place.
</p>
<h4>
    Controlled Deployment
</h4>
<p>
    Achieving compliance in the area of deployment of software to production can be a significant challenge. The list below
    identifies issues that are common in organizations today.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Absence of consistent best practices for deployment
    </li>
    <li>
        Inconsistent platform configurations, patch levels, dependent software, and layered products
    </li>
    <li>
        Difficulties with secure deployment of code beyond multi-tiered firewalls
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment of servers from bare metal chassis
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment to pervasive devices like PalmOS, PocketPC, or mobile phones
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As the stack of dependent applications and layered products thickens, the complexity of deploying applications into
    production increases.
</p>
<p>
    In order to stay on top of the velocity of change to applications -- and of the breadth of technical infrastructure,
    and the depth of knowledge required to implement such changes across domains, server platforms, middleware, and
    organizations -- businesses must track configurations and automate deployment.
</p>
<p>
    This can only be accomplished by capturing best practices in automated deployment within the organization, as supported
    by IBM Tivoli Configuration Manager (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/toolmentors/rcm_tcm_for_compliance_75F44F07.html" guid="_VXWMAPuFEdqd86I-vfQ0Jw">Tool Mentor: Compliance Management Support in Tivoli Configuration Manager</a>).<br />

    Context
</h5>
<p class="text-normal">
    One activity in <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../govern.compliance/guidances/guidelines/rcm_release_management_workflow_D4EEB0BC.html" guid="_xk71QMw0EdqV26RhCpjg4g">Tivoli Release Management</a> is <i>Deploy a Release</i>. The rollout of a Release
    Package is performed in this activity. The Release Package is deployed to all Change Items (CI) that are identified in
    the Rollout Plan. The Release Package is deployed as provided, without any modifications. After distribution,
    installation, and configuration, the changes are checked to ensure the functional integrity of the changes. This
    activity might involve automated checks, user surveys, or other approaches.<br />
    <br />
     The change management database is updated to reflect the fact that specific requests for change (RFC) have been
    deployed. A subsequent review of the related RFCs is performed by the Change Management process.

<h5>
    Details
</h5>
<p class="text-normal">
    The Tivoli Provisioning Manager contains a component called the deployment engine, which is ultimately responsible for
    workflow executions that have a direct impact towards change within an infrastructure.
</p>
<p class="text-normal">
    Release Packages are deployed using the workflow functionality within Tivoli Provisioning Manager. Release Packages
    (usually in the form of software products) can have a wide variety of configuration parameters, which are configured at
    workflow runtime. The parameters are harvested at runtime from multiple possible sources, including workflow parameters
    that are passed at runtime, or parameters that are encapsulated within the data center model (DCM) information that
    describes the datacenter environment.

        Figure 1 : An example of a workflow following successful execution
    </p>
    <p class="text-normal">
        Following successful execution of workflows, the DCM is updated to reflect any changes to infrastructure items,
        which can include inventory lists against a specific server instance. For example, a workflow might deploy an
        instance of a software package against a server within the datacenter. Following the successful execution of the
        <em>Software.Install</em> workflow against this device, the inventory of the server would receive an update to
        reflect the additional software that is now located on that resource.
    </p>
    <p class="text-normal">
        With advanced features such as conditionals, looping, and branching, workflows have a very powerful capability to
        provision software elements, configuration parameters, or reconfigure items within the datacenter.
    </p>
    <p class="text-normal">
        In addition to executing a workflow manually to deploy a release, workflows might be executed
        <em>automatically</em> based on an existing condition, or as part of a larger overall workflow process routine
        (such as the addition of a server into a cluster, for example). Workflows provide administrators with the
        flexibility to customize their deployment operations in a wide variety of implementations.
    </p>
    <p class="text-normal">
        Examples of the real value that workflows provide -- along with samples of various software product standards that
        are supported -- can be located on the IBM IT Service Management workflows Web page located at <a href="http://www.ibm.com/software/tivoli/features/opal/">http://www.ibm.com/software/tivoli/features/opal/</a>. It
        provides access to information such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="text-normal">How can workflows help reduce costs within my environment?</span>
        </li>
        <li class="text-normal">
            What are some examples of workflows (included within the default installation of Tivoli Provisioning Manager)
            that will allow me to deploy existing releases with minimal effort?
        </li>
        <li class="text-normal">
            How can I develop <em>automation plans</em> to ease the administrative issues within my environment?
        </li>
        <li class="text-normal">
            What tools and strategies are available to improve our workflow development process?
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-normal">
        The open nature of workflows -- by their design -- allows for very simple integration into a wide variety of
        third-party solutions (including products from companies other than IBM). Should an organization include products
        to carry out specific aspects of release rollout, Tivoli Provisioning Manager workflows can easily integrate and
        utilize a wide variety of toolsets. By integrating these tools into the release deployment process, IT
        organizations will be able to significantly reduce costs they might otherwise spend on additional tools and
        training.
    </p>
    <p class="text-normal">
        An online catalog of release deployment workflows, which provide functionality into a wide variety of
        industry-standard products, is available through the IBM Open Process Automation Library. This library is
        accessible online at <a href="http://www.developer.ibm.com/tivoli/workflow.html" target="_parent">http://www.developer.ibm.com/tivoli/workflow.html</a> .<br />

    <a id="Explanation" name="Explanation">Explanation</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Use cases and actors interact by sending signals to one another. To indicate such interactions we use a
    <b>communicate-association</b> between use-case and actor. A use-case has at most one communicate-association to a
    specific actor, and an actor has at most one communicate-association to a specific use-case, no matter how many signal
    transmissions there are. The complete network of such associations is a static picture of the communication between the
    system and its environment.
</p>
<p>
    Communicate-associations are not given names. Because there can be only one communicate-association between a use-case
    and an actor, you need only specify the start and end points to identify a particular communicate-association.
</p>

</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    A line or arrow between an actor and a use case indicates they interact by sending signals to one another.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Roles" name="Roles">Roles</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Each end of a communicate-association is a <b>role</b> specifying the face that a use case or actor plays in the
    association<i>.</i> The roles are used to specify multiplicities and directions of the association (see below).
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Multiplicity" name="Multiplicity">Multiplicity</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Each role of a communicate-association indicates the <b>multiplicity</b> of its type, that is, how many instances of
    that actor or use case can be associated with one instance of the other use case or actor. Multiplicity is indicated by
    a text expression on the role. The expression is a comma-separated list of integer ranges. A range is indicated by an
    integer (the lower value), two dots, and an integer (the upper value); a single integer is a valid range, and the
    symbol '*' indicates "many", that is, an unlimited number of objects. The symbol '*' by itself is equivalent to '0..*',
    that is, any number including none; this is the default value. An optional scalar role has the multiplicity 0..1.
</p>
<p>
    The multiplicity&nbsp;can be augmented with a time unit constraint. This is&nbsp;performed to state how many instances
    that&nbsp;can be associated, possibly by different instances, during the time unit. This information is
    useful&nbsp;because, it can tell us if the use case is performed often, and also how often each actor instance employs
    the use case.
</p>
<h5>
    Example:
</h5>
<p align="center">
    <img height="105" alt="Diagram described in accompanying text." src="./../../../practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/./resources/md_coma4.gif" width="450" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    The Conduct Transactions use case is used 400,000 times per day by Customers. Each Customer employs the use case two
    times per month.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Navigability" name="Navigability">Navigability</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Each role of a communicate-association has a <b>navigability</b> property, indicating who initiates communication in
    the interaction.&nbsp; Navigability is shown by an open arrowhead.&nbsp; If the arrowhead points to a use case, the
    actor at the other end of the association initiates the interaction with the system.&nbsp; If the arrowhead points to
    an actor, the system initiates the interaction with the actor.&nbsp; Two-way navigability is shown by a line with no
    arrow-heads (two arrow-heads tends to clutter diagrams).
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="211" alt="Diagram described in accompanying text." src="./../../../practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/./resources/comasso2.gif" width="446" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    The communication arrow defines the actor that initiated the use case. For each communication arrow the return message
    is assumed. A line with no arrow heads assumes two-way communication.
</p>
<p>
    Do not confuse navigability with data flow; i<span>t is used to show initiation of communication only.&nbsp; For
    example, a customer request for data is shown by an arrow to the use case representing the system, even though most of
    the data flows from the system to the customer.</span>
</p>
<h3>
    Communication from Actor to Use Case
</h3>
<p>
    Actors communicate with the system by sending signals. To fully understand the role of the actor, you must know which
    use cases the actor is involved in. This is shown by communicate-associations between the actor and the use cases.
</p>
<p>
    The multiplicity of the association shows how many instances of a use case one instance of an actor can communicate
    with at the same time.
</p>
<h5>
    Example:
</h5>
<p class="example">
    In the Recycling Machine System, each time an instance of the actor Customer hands in a deposit item, he sends a signal
    to the associated instance of the use case Recycle Items. When the actor is finished, the use case prints out a
    receipt. A Customer can communicate with only one instance of Recycle Items. Thus, the multiplicity of the association
    is 1. The receipt returned from the system is considered here as a response from the use-case instance; thus, the
    communicate-association needs no navigability in the other direction.
</p>
<p class="picturecenter" align="center">
    <img height="68" alt="Diagram described in accompanying text." src="./../../../practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/./resources/md_coma2.gif" width="236" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    A Customer who wants to return deposit items into a recycling machine will communicate with the use case Recycle Items.
</p>
<p>
    An actor communicates with use cases for many reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        To&nbsp;start a use case.
    </li>
    <li>
        To ask for some data stored in the system, which the use case then fetches and presents to the actor.
    </li>
    <li>
        To change the data stored in the system by means of a dialog with the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        To report that something special has happened in the system's surroundings that the system&nbsp;must take care of.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="Communication from Use Case to Actor" name="Communication from Use Case to Actor">Communication from Use Case to
    Actor</a>
</h3>
<p>
    One actor initiates a use case. However, once it has started, the use case can communicate with several actors. You can
    use communicate-associations between the use case and the actors to show which actors the use case communicates with.
    The association's multiplicity shows how many instances of an actor one instance of a use case can communicate with at
    the same time.
</p>
<p>
    Use cases communicate with actors for many reasons, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If something special has taken place in the system, an actor might need to know.
    </li>
    <li>
        A use case might&nbsp;need to ask an actor for help in making a decision if several options are available.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is common, but not always true, that the use case waits for an answer when it has sent a signal to an actor.
    This&nbsp;must be explicitly described in the use case.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Optional Conventions" name="Optional Conventions">Optional Conventions</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The following are common optional conventions which make it clear which actor initiates the use case.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span>The initiating actor-to-use-case arrowhead is always shown, even if the use case later initiates
        communication to the initiating actor.&nbsp; This is also the only actor-to-use-case arrowhead shown.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span>Arrowheads from use case to actors&nbsp;can be omitted, or&nbsp;can be included for clarity.</span>
    </li>

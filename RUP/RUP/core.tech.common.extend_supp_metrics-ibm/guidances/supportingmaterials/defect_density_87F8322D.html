    Purpose
</h3>
<p>
    Defect Density&nbsp;indicates the code quality attained in the deliverable, based on the number of defects found,
    fixed, and remaining (not yet fixed). When comparing data over multiple releases, you should be able to draw
    conclusions about how well you have managed to identify defects.
</p>
<p>
    While this Defect Density description focuses on pre-release analysis, Defect Density can be monitored post-release to
    track how many defects are found by customers (not identified during development).
</p>
<h3>
    Definition
</h3>
<p>
    Defect Density = Number of total defects found, closed (fixed), and remaining per some unit (typically SLOC). It can be
    useful to view defects grouped by:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Component</b>, to determine whether any particular component has quality issues (this can be called <i>defect
        density by component</i> or <i>defect distribution by component</i>)
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Requirement</b>, to determine whether any particular requirement has quality issues (this can be called
        <i>defect density by requirement</i> or <i>defect distribution by requirement</i>)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Average Defect Density = Number of total defects found, closed (fixed), and remaining / unit
</p>
<p>
    In this measurement method, <code>unit</code> can be source line of code or SLOC (<code>total</code>, and <code>new or
    changed <font face="Arial">SLOCs</font></code>), FunctionPoint, use case, or whatever else you measure. It can also be
    useful to group by component or requirement, and use in conjunction with defect density (mentioned previously).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Count</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Total defects found, closed, and remaining
    </li>
    <li>
        Unit: SLOC, FunctionPoint, use case, or whatever else you measure.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    You can use a bar, stacked bar, or grouped (stacked) bar chart to show the number of defects in each category,
    depending on whether you are viewing by component or requirement, by severity, or simply totals. To show trends over
    time, you can use a series of bars, or a line chart.
</p>
<p>
    During development, expect to see the total defect count increase in relation to your testing activities. While you
    want to see the number of closed defects increasing as well, there may still be a large number of defects remaining (a
    defect is not closed until the fix has been verified).
</p>
<p>
    As you&nbsp;prepare the deliverable for shipment, you typically want to see a low number of remaining defects, and few
    or no remaining high-severity defects. Set targets for an acceptable level of remaining defects (usually a percentage
    of the total, with perhaps zero outstanding high-severity defects).
</p>
<p>
    A high number of total defects is not necessarily bad, as long as your total fixed defects is acceptable. You can set
    targets for these numbers based on historical data. For example, this could be your historical defect rate per SLOC (or
    function point, or whatever you are measuring) on previous similar projects, or within the organization.
</p>
<p>
    Defect density should decline over time: 4-6% annually over the long term. Defect density and trending should be used
    to estimate maintenance effort on a project. As new code is implemented, the defect density should track the existing
    trends. Once the SLOCs are known, you can estimate the number of defects and multiply by the average repair time to
    estimate the effort required to implement the maintenance operations. Typical defect densities at customer ship are 0.8
    to 1.0 defects for new code, and decline rapidly in the first year to 0.08 to 0.1 defects per 1,000 SLOC for existing
    code. This decline is also an indication of the usage of the product.
</p>

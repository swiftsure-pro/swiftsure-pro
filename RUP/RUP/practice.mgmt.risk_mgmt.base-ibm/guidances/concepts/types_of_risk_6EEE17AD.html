    It's important to distinguish between direct and indirect risks. Simply put, a direct risk is one which we have some
    degree of control over; indirect risks are ones which we cannot control.
</p>
<p>
    While one should not be ignorant of the indirect risks, they are of little consequence in a practical sense: since one
    cannot change them, there is little to be gained by worrying about them. Despite the fact that the world <i>may</i> end
    tomorrow, it also <i>may</i> <i>not</i> end, and if it does not we had better get on with the work at hand!
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes, an indirect risk may really be a direct risk in disguise. For example, we may be dependent on some external
    supplier for a component or set of components. This appears to be an indirect risk, but by having contingency plans for
    those components, we can take control over the risk: we can choose alternate suppliers, or we can choose to develop the
    functionality ourselves. In many cases, we have more control than we think!
</p>
<p>
    With indirect risks, you either have to figure out how to gain some degree of control over the risks, or you simply
    make note of them and move on. There is little point agonizing over what you cannot change.

</h3>
<p>
    Experience shows that 85% of the risks have a direct or indirect impact on the schedule, and therefore implicitly on
    cost. Maybe 5% have only a cost impact. The rest have no direct impact on cost or schedule, but on quality for example.
</p>
<p>
    If a deadline is the enemy, approach it smoothly with incremental deliveries. Avoid having one massive delivery in an
    attempt to make the schedule.
</p>
<p>
    Some projects have real "drop-dead" deadlines. Software to analyze "live" the result of an election during election
    night, for example, has little value if it comes the week after the election. Or your software may be made obsolete by
    competitors: they launch a product better than yours while you're still in the middle of construction. Suddenly, you're
    not in the game anymore - and you can't do much about it. In general, however, few projects have such a critical
    deadline. Delays mostly affect cost.
</p>
<p>
    In general, make your schedule commitment equal to your best estimate, plus some reasonable contingency.
</p>
<p align="center">
    Commitment = Estimate + Contingency
</p>
<p>
    Others have advised setting schedule expectations to be equal to your fallback strategy, that is, to base them on your
    contingency plans, but this is a little too pessimistic because not <i>all</i> risks will actually materialize.
</p>
<p>
    Schedule risks are integrated in some estimating and costing tools. For example in the COCOMO model, many of the cost
    drivers are actually risk factors. These drivers include the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Complexity (cplx)
    </li>
    <li>
        Real-time constraints (time)
    </li>
    <li>
        Storage constraints (stor)
    </li>
    <li>
        Experience (Vexp)
    </li>
    <li>
        Availability of good tools (tool)
    </li>
    <li>
        Schedule pressure (sced)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    More sophisticated techniques for risk management involve the use of Monte Carlo simulation, in which huge numbers of
    "scenarios" are run by a simulation tool to compute overall risks and contingencies [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#KAR96" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">KAR96</a>].

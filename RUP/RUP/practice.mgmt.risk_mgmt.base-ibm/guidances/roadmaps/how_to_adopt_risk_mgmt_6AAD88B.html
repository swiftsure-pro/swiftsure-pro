    Getting Started
</h3>
<p>
    To get started with adopting this practice, identify if your organization already has a defined risk management process
    that your project could follow, and decide on whether to follow the organization process (as is) or to adapt the
    process to your project needs. You may want to use - or refine to your project needs - risk management related areas
    such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Approach to identify, analyze and prioritize risks
    </li>
    <li>
        List of&nbsp;potential sources of risk and&nbsp;typical risk categories, as well as impacted stakeholders
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="jazz-ui-SideNavigationLayout-contentArea" dojoattachpoint="_contentArea"><span         class="jazz-ui-SideNavigationLayout-contentArea" dojoattachpoint="_contentArea"><span         class="jazz-ui-SideNavigationLayout-contentArea" dojoattachpoint="_contentArea">List of risk management strategies
        that will be used in your project</span></span></span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <span class="jazz-ui-SideNavigationLayout-contentArea" dojoattachpoint="_contentArea"><span         class="jazz-ui-SideNavigationLayout-contentArea" dojoattachpoint="_contentArea"><span         class="jazz-ui-SideNavigationLayout-contentArea" dojoattachpoint="_contentArea">Strategy
        to&nbsp;monitor</span></span></span> each significant risk and its mitigation activities
    </li>
    <li>
        Groups or individuals involved in the project's risk management activities for your project, and their
        responsibilities
    </li>
    <li>
        Budget available in your project for managing project risks
    </li>
    <li>
        Tools and techniques that will be used in your project to store risk information, evaluate risks, track the status
        of risks or generate risk management reports
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can accelerate&nbsp;the risk identification process for your project if you start with a list of known and expected
    types of risks for projects in your organization.
</p>
<p>
    Create a list of prioritized risks (ranked by risk exposure) and come up with strategies to address the "top 10" or so
    risks only. It may not be worth, from a financial perspective, to come up with strategies for all the identified risks
    (for some risks, the best strategy may even be acceptance).
</p>
<p>
    Everyone in the team&nbsp;is responsible for risk management, in other words, the team and stakeholders collaborate
    to&nbsp;identify, asses, and propose strategies to deal with risks. Not everyone&nbsp;will necessarily be responsible
    for implementing&nbsp;strategies to address one or more risks or become&nbsp;a "risk owner",&nbsp;although it is
    expected that at some point in the project&nbsp;lifecycle a team member&nbsp;could be&nbsp;requested - or volunteer -
    to take ownership of risks actions.
</p>
<p>
    Evaluate and assess risks periodically. Recognize that changes will happen throughout the project and that risks need
    to be identified and assessed on a regular basis, minimally at each iteration of phase of your project.
</p>
<h3>
    Common Pitfalls
</h3>
<h4>
    Not involving relevant stakeholders in risk identification
</h4>
<p>
    The whole team and stakeholders need to participate in the risk identification activity. If you involve only one group
    in risk identification,&nbsp;for example only&nbsp;the project team, you may end up not capturing risks that are
    relevant to other groups, such as business and marketing risks, etc. If you identify risks with external stakeholders
    and do not include the team in risk identification, you may miss important risks related to technology and scope, to
    name a few types.
</p>
<h4>
    Identifying risks only at the beginning of the project
</h4>
<p>
    A common pitfall that leads to poor risk management is to think that risks need to be identified only at the beginning
    of the project without the need to revisit the risk list often. New risks do appear throughout the project, and
    previously identified risks may never happen (those with low likelihood of happening), so it is essential to revisit
    risks throughout the project at intervals when the team and stakeholders meet to identify new risks and assess if
    identified risk actions are being effective.

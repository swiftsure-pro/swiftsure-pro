    This artifact describes the operational distribution of a system's components (which may be grouped into deployment
    units) onto nodes, the placement of nodes and users across locations, the connections between nodes necessary to
    support the required interactions between components, in order to achieve the system's functional and non-functional
    requirements within the constraints of technology, skills and budget.
</p>
<h5>
    Operational Modeling Terminology
</h5>
<p>
    This artifact's (and that of its contained artifacts) terminology is defined within the System Description Standard R3
    Semantic Specification (see Guidance for link) which includes definitions for the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Actors (and workers) – the roles a user or an external system play with respect to the target system
    </li>
    <li>
        Locations – a geographical area or position.
    </li>
    <li>
        Borders – representing the existing connection between two locations
    </li>
    <li>
        Components - modular units of functionality, which make this functionality available through an interface.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deployment Units – a grouping of facets of a component that have similar characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connectors – enable the exchange of messages (interactions) between resource containers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Interactions – identify the messages exchanged between one or two resource containers in the context of a
        collaboration, and the sequencing of these messages via their associated send/receive events.
    </li>
    <li>
        Nodes - a collection of components fulfilling a specific responsibility with a certain quality of service within
        the target system.
    </li>
    <li>
        Connections - supports the required connectivity between connectable model elements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Zones – an aggregation of a number of model elements with a common (sub-) set of values for a particular
        non-functional requirement and/or non-functional characteristic.
    </li>
    <li>
        Boundaries - associated with a change in value for a particular non-functional requirement and/or characteristic
        between two model elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending on the development approach adopted and/or the context, it can be very helpful to create levels of this
    artifact.&nbsp; The two basic levels of this artifact are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Logical</strong>:&nbsp; This level describes the characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect
        of the system architecture in a <strong>technology independent and product neutral</strong> manner.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Physical</strong>:&nbsp; This level describes characteristics and capabilities of the operational aspect of
        the system architecture in a <strong>technology and product dependent</strong> manner.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both levels of this artifact may be further described at three different sub-levels relating to the degree to which the
    level has been sized:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Unsized</strong> (or unranged) – the technology and products are specified to support the components
        deployed but not sized and without detailing how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Ranged</strong> – the technology and products are specified to support a bounded range of requirements for
        a defined range of circumstances.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sized</strong> – the technology and products are specified and sized to support the components deployed and
        details how the system will achieve the service level characteristics.
    </li>
</ul></td>

    Levels of this artifact
</h5>
<p>
    The artifact can be a large and complex work product.&nbsp; It is therefore important to understand how it may be best
    developed and presented, depending on the particular context.
</p>
<p>
    In order to reduce the complexity of the development process, the various development techniques available take
    advantage of a number of well-defined views and levels of completeness.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore this artifact can be refined and elaborated in various ways depending on the nature of the project life cycle
    and the development techniques used.&nbsp; Useful intermediate stages of development have been defined for both the
    <strong>logical</strong> and <strong>physical</strong> levels of this artifact as described within this artifact.
</p>
<h5>
    Degree of completeness (elaboration) and quality (refinement)
</h5>
<p>
    Individual circumstances will dictate the degree of completeness (including omission) of each level of this
    artifact.&nbsp; Decisions on level of detail, focus and completeness will be based on many factors, such as
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Audience (e.g. business people, IT Architects, or Developers)
    </li>
    <li>
        Purpose (is it to be fully specified and configured or a generalized reference pattern?)
    </li>
    <li>
        Completeness (is it early in a project's life, or a finished artifact?)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The degree of completeness reached (or required) will also be dependent on the development process (e.g. waterfall,
    iterative, etc.).&nbsp; The levels of this artifact elaborate through degrees of completeness towards their completed
    states while remaining synchronized and consistent with one another at each major project "milestone".
</p>
<h5>
    Varying depth of detail
</h5>
<p>
    As well describing the operational aspect of a complete IT system, it is often helpful to develop this artifact showing
    greater detail for particular parts of the system.&nbsp; For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        This artifact may model a whole IT system as one or two nodes on the overall model, but a further more detailed
        representation of parts of the IT system in a particular location may also be constructed.
    </li>
    <li>
        This artifact may model a single part of an IT system in detail without modeling the whole IT system.
    </li>
    <li>
        This artifact may include the same "recurring pattern" of nodes and/or connections, and, in this case, a separate
        artifact may detail the recurring pattern and be referenced by the main artifact.
    </li>
</ul>
<h5>
    Cross-cutting viewpoints
</h5>
<p>
    This artifact and the logical and physical levels of this artifact may be the focus of a particular viewpoint, at any
    degree of elaboration and refinement, to address the concerns of a particular stakeholder. These cross-cutting
    viewpoints overlap with one another.&nbsp; For example, views may be constructed on this artifact for the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Application
    </li>
    <li>
        Technical
    </li>
    <li>
        Performance
    </li>
    <li>
        Capacity
    </li>
    <li>
        Availability and Recovery
    </li>
    <li>
        Security and Privacy Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Operability and Operations Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Systems Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Software Distribution and Installation
    </li>
    <li>
        Distributed Data Management
    </li>
    <li>
        Problem Identification and Management
    </li>
    <li>
        End User Support/Helpdesk
    </li>
    <li>
        Networking
    </li>
    <li>
        Accessibility
    </li>
    <li>
        National Language Support
    </li>
    <li>
        Financial proprietary
    </li>
    <li>
        Archiving
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Such filtering does not generally change the elements in the artifact rather it simply enables a clearer focus on some
    particular part of it.
</p>

    Please refer to "An Introduction to the IBM Views and Viewpoints Framework for IT Systems" Whitepaper for further
    details on the views and viewpoints framework including the relationship between base and cross-cutting views.
</p>
<h5>
    Linkages to other work products
</h5>
<p>
    As well as a linkage via Deployment Units with the functional aspect of architecture as embodied in the Component
    Model, this artifact has influences and/or is strongly interdependent on other areas that cover the design of the
    infrastructure that will implement the operational aspect of architecture. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Network Design: affects the application design, middleware selection, component placement, security and privacy,
        systems management and overall operational system control.
    </li>
    <li>
        Platform Design; the detailed design and configuration of the platforms that will implement the nodes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Storage Design; the detailed design and configuration of storage which may be shared across multiple platforms.
    </li>
    <li>
        Site & Facilities Design; the detailed design and configuration of the site and facilities in the locations in
        which nodes (implemented by platforms) are placed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Systems Management design; through its definition of how the IT system is spread out over locations and what
        systems management components and nodes are needed at each location.&nbsp; Selection of a systems management style
        is an important decision, which determines: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                The cost of operations management
            </li>
            <li>
                The cost of software distribution
            </li>
            <li>
                The complexity of system management tooling
            </li>
            <li>
                Potential security and performance of the IT system (ability to satisfy the service level requirements)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Existing or planned enterprise-wide IT infrastructure initiatives on which the target system will be
        implemented.&nbsp; For example, enterprise wide middleware decisions may well move function, which would otherwise
        be duplicated across multiple applications, into a set of shared services, which are usually purchased or part of
        an enterprise wide development effort.

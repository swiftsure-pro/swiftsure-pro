<ul>
    <li>
        Metrics must be simple, objective, easy to collect, easy to interpret, and hard to misinterpret.
    </li>
    <li>
        Metrics collection must be automated and non-intrusive, that is, not interfere with the activities of the
        developers.
    </li>
    <li>
        Metrics must contribute to quality assessment early in the lifecycle, when efforts to improve software quality are
        effective.
    </li>
    <li>
        Metric absolute values and trends must be actively used by management personnel and engineering personnel for
        communicating progress and quality in a consistent format.
    </li>
    <li>
        The selection of a minimal or more extensive set of metrics will depend on the project's characteristics and
        context: if it is large or has stringent safety or reliability requirements and the development and assessment
        teams are knowledgeable about metrics, then it may be useful to collect and analyze the technical metrics. The
        contract may require certain metrics to be collected, or the organization may be trying to improve it skills an
        processes in particular areas. There is no simple answer to fit all circumstances, the Project Manager must select
        what is appropriate when the Measurement Plan is produced. When introducing a metrics program for the first time
        though, it is sensible to err on the side of simplicity.

</h3>
<p>
    Metrics for certain aspects of the project, include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Progress in terms of size and complexity.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stability in terms of rate of change in the requirements or implementation, size, or complexity.
    </li>
    <li>
        Modularity in terms of the scope of change.
    </li>
    <li>
        Quality in terms of the number and type of errors.
    </li>
    <li>
        Maturity in terms of the frequency of errors.
    </li>
    <li>
        Resources in terms of project expenditure versus planned expenditure
    </li>

    <b>Trends</b> are important, and somewhat more important to monitor than any absolute value in time.

</h3>
<p>
    Even the smallest projects will want to track progress to determine if the project is on schedule and on budget, and if
    not, to re-estimate and determine if scope changes are needed. This minimal metrics set will therefore focus on
    progress metrics.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Earned Value. This is used to re-estimate the schedule and budget for the remainder of the project, and/or to
        identify need for scope changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Defect Trends. This is used to help project the effort required to work off defects.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test Progress Trend. This is used to determine how much functionality is actually complete.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are described in more detail below.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="earned_value" name="earned_value"></a>Earned Value
</h4>
<p>
    The most commonly used method ([<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#PMI96" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">PMI96</a>]) to measure progress is Earned Value Analysis.
</p>
<p>
    The simplest way to measure earned value is to take the sum of the original estimated effort for all completed tasks. A
    "percent complete" for the project can be computed as the earned value divided by the total original estimated effort
    for the project. Productivity (or Performance Index) is the earned value divided by the actual effort spend on the
    complete tasks.
</p>
<p>
    For example, suppose the coding effort has been divided into several tasks, many of which are now complete. The
    original estimate for the completed tasks was 30 effort days. The total estimated effort for the project was 100 days,
    so we can project that the project is roughly 30% complete.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Graph of Earned Value Progress" src="./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/metrics2.gif" />
</p>
<p>
    Suppose the tasks were completed under budget - requiring only 25 days to complete. The Performance Index is 30 / 25 =
    1.2 or 120%.<br />
    We can project that the project will complete 20% under budget, and reduce our estimates accordingly.
</p>
<h5>
    Considerations
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        The Performance Index must only be used to adjust estimates for similar tasks. Early completion of requirements
        gathering tasks does not suggest that coding will complete more quickly. So, compute the Performance Index only for
        similar kinds of tasks, and adjust estimates only for similar tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Consider other factors. Will future tasks be performed by similarly skilled staff under similar conditions? Has the
        data been contaminated by "outliers" - tasks which were severely over-estimated or under-estimated? Is time being
        reported consistently (for example, overtime should be included even if not paid)?
    </li>
    <li>
        Are estimates for newer tasks already accounting for the Performance Index? If so, then estimates for new tasks
        will tend to be closer to the target, pushing the performance index closer to 100%. You should either consistently
        re-estimate all incomplete tasks, or adopt the following practice from Extreme Programming (XP)[<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#JEF01" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">JEF01</a>] - refer to the original estimates as "points", and measure new tasks in
        terms of these same "points" without adjusting for actual performance . The advantage of "points" is that increases
        (or decreases) in performance can be tracked ("project velocity" in XP terminology).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If tasks are large (more than 5 days), or there are a lot of tasks which are partially complete, you may wish to factor
    them into your analysis. Apply a subjective "percent completion", multiply this by the task's effort estimate, and
    include this in the earned value. Greater consistency in results is obtained if there are clear rules for assigning the
    percent complete. For example, one rule could be that a coding task is assigned no more than 80% complete until the
    code has passed a code review.

<h4>
    Defect Trend
</h4>
<p>
    It is often useful to track the trend of open and closed defects. This provides a rough indication as to whether there
    is a significant backlog of defect fixing work to be completed and how quickly they are being closed.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Graph of Defect Trend" src="./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/metrics1.gif" />

<p>
    Defect trends are just one of the metrics provided by Rational ProjectConsole.
</p>
<h5>
    Considerations
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>
        All change requests should not have equal weight, whether they affect one line of code or cause major re-design.
        This can be addressed by some of the following techniques: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Be aware of outliers. Change Requests which require substantial work should be identified as such and be
                tracked as separate tasks, not bundled into a bucket of general bug fixing. If lots of tiny fixes are
                dominating the trend, then consider grouping them so that each Change Request represents a more consistent
                unit of work.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can record more information, such as a subjective "effort category" of "less than 1 day" "1 day" "less
                than 5 days" "more than 5 days".
            </li>
            <li>
                You can record estimated SLOCs and actual SLOCs for each Change Request. See <a href="#A Small Set of Metrics">A Small Set of Metrics</a> below.<br />
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        A lack of defects being recorded may imply a lack of testing. Be aware of the level of test effort occurring when
        examining defect trends.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Test Progress Trend
</h4>
<p>
    The ultimate measure of completeness is how much functionality has been integrated.<br />
    If each of your development tasks represents a set of integrated functionality, then an earned value trend chart may be
    sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    A very simple way to communicate progress is with a Test Progress Trend.<br />
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Graph of Acceptance Test Progress" src="./../../../practice.mgmt.iterative_dev.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/metrics3.gif" />
</p>
<h5>
    Considerations
</h5>Some test cases may represent significantly more value or effort than others. Don't read too much into this graph - it
just provides some assurance that there is progress towards completed functionality.<br />

<h4>
    <a id="The Product" name="The Product">The Product</a>
</h4>
<p>
    The products in the Rational Unified Process (RUP) are the Work Products, which are documents, models, or model
    elements. The models are collections of like things (the model elements) so the recommended metrics are listed here
    with the models to which they apply: it is usually obvious if a metric applies to the model as a whole, or an element.
    Explanatory text is provided where this is not clear.
</p>
<h4>
    Work Product Characteristics
</h4>
<p>
    In general, the characteristics we are interested in measuring are the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Size -</b> a measure of the number of things in a model, the length of something, the extent or mass of
            something
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Quality</b> 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Defects <b>-</b> indications that a work product does not perform as specified or is not compliant with
                    its specification, or has other undesirable characteristics
                </li>
                <li>
                    Complexity <b>-</b> a measure of the intricacy of a structure or algorithm: the greater the complexity,
                    the more difficult a structure is to understand and modify, and there is evidence that complex
                    structures are more likely to fail
                </li>
                <li>
                    Coupling <b>-</b> a measure of the how extensively elements of a system are interconnected
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cohesion <b>-</b> a measure of how well an element or component meets the requirement of having a
                    single, well-defined, purpose
                </li>
                <li>
                    Primitiveness <b>-</b> the degree to which operations or methods of a class can be composed from others
                    offered by the class
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Completeness</b> <b>-</b> a measure of the extent to which a work product meets all requirements (stated and
            implied<b>-</b>the Project Manager should strive to make explicit as much as possible, to limit the risk of
            unfulfilled expectations). We have not chosen here to distinguish between <i>sufficient</i> and
            <i>complete</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Traceability -</b> an indication that the requirements at one level are being satisfied by work products at
            a lower level, and, looking the other way, that a work product at any level has a reason to exist
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Volatility -</b> the degree of change or inconclusiveness in a work product because of defects or changing
            requirements
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Effort -</b> a measure of the work (staff-time units) that is required to produce a work product
        </li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Not all of these characteristics apply to all work products: the relevant ones are elaborated with the particular work
    product in the following tables. Where several metrics are listed against a characteristic, all are potentially of
    interest, because they give a complete description of the characteristic from several viewpoints. For example, when
    considering the traceability of Use Cases, ultimately all have to be traceable to a (tested) implementation model: in
    the interim, it will still be of interest to the Project Manager to know how many Use Cases can be traced to the
    Analysis Model, as a measure of progress.

<p>
    Here we see some OO-specific technical metrics that may be unfamiliar<b>-</b>depth of inheritance tree, number of
    children, response for a class, coupling between objects, and so on. See [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#HEND96" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">HEND96</a>] for details of the meaning and history of these metrics. Several of these
    metrics were originally suggested by Chidamber and Kemerer (see "A metrics suite for object oriented design", IEEE
    Transactions on Software Engineering, 20(6), 1994), but we have applied them here as suggested in [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#HEND96" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">HEND96</a>] and have preferred the definition of LCOM (lack of cohesion in methods)
    presented in that work.

    * Some method of measuring code size should be chosen and then consistently applied, for example non-comment,
    non-blank. See [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#ROY98" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">ROY98</a>] for a discussion of the merits and application of 'lines of code' as a
    metric. Also see the same reference for the definition of 'breakage'.

        These are measures that come from the application of Earned Value Techniques to project management; together they
        are called Cost/Schedule Control Systems Criteria (C/SCSC). A simple earned value technique is described above as
        part of <a href="#A Minimal Set of Metrics">A Minimal Set of Metrics</a>. More detailed analyses can be
        performed using related metrics, including:

<h4>
    <a id="The Project" name="The Project">The Project</a>
</h4>
<p>
    The project needs to be characterized in terms of type, size, complexity and formality (although type, size and
    complexity usually determine formality), because these aspects will condition expectations about various thresholds for
    lower level measures. Other constraints should be captured in the contract (or specifications). Metrics derived from
    the process, product and resources will capture all other project level metrics. Project type and domain can be
    recorded using a text description, making sure that there is enough detail to accurately characterize the project.
    Record the project size by cost, effort, duration, size of code to be developed, function points to be delivered. The
    project's complexity can be described - somewhat subjectively<b>-</b>by placing the project on a chart showing
    technical and management complexity relative to other completed projects. [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#ROY98" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">ROY98</a>], Figure 14-1 shows such a diagram.
</p>
<p>
    The derived metrics described in [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#ROY98" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">ROY98</a>], which are the Project Manager's main indicators, can be obtained from the
    metrics gathered for product and process. These are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Modularity</b> = average breakage (NCNB*) per perfective or corrective change on implementation model
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Adaptability</b> = average effort per perfective or corrective change on implementation model
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Maturity</b> = active test time/number of corrective changes
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Maintainability</b> = Maintenance Productivity/Development Productivity = [actual cumulative fixes/cumulative
        effort for perfective and corrective changes]/[estimated number of NCNB at completion/estimated production effort
        at completion]
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rework stability</b> = cumulative breakage-cumulative fixes
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Rework backlog</b> = [cumulative breakage-cumulative fixes]/NCNB unit tested
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    * NCNB is non-comment, non-blank code size.
</p>
<p>
    Progress should be reported from the project plan using work product completion metrics - with particular weight (from
    an earned value perspective) being given to the production of working software.
</p>
<p>
    If an estimation model such as COCOMO (see [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html#BOE81" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">BOE81</a>] is used, the various scale factors and cost drivers should be recorded.
    These actually form a quite detailed characterization of the project.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="The Resources" name="The Resources">The Resources</a>
</h4>
<p>
    The items to be measured include people (experience, skills, cost, performance), methods and tools (in terms of effect
    on productivity and quality, cost), time, effort, budget (resources consumed, resources remaining).
</p>
<p>
    The staffing profile should be recorded over time, showing type (analyst, designer, and so on), grade (which implies
    cost), and team to which it's allocated. Both actuals and plan should be recorded.
</p>
<p>
    Again, the COCOMO model requires the characterization of personnel experience and capability and software development
    environment, and is a good framework in which to keep these metrics.
</p>
<p>
    Expenditure, budget, and schedule information will come from the Project Plan.

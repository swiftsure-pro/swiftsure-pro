    Set up the test environment to ensure that all of the required components (hardware, software, tools, data, and so on)
    have been established, and are available and ready in the test environment in the correct state to enable the tests to
    be conducted. Typically, this will involve some form of basic environment reset (for example, Registry and other
    configuration files), restoration of underlying databases to the require state, and the setup of any peripheral devices
    (such as loading paper into printers). While some tasks can be performed automatically, some aspects typically require
    human attention.
</p>
<p>
    The use of environment support tools (such as those that enable hard-disk image capture and restoration) is extremely
    valuable in managing this effort effectively.

<td><p>
    Set the execution options of the supporting tools. Depending on the sophistication of the tool, there may be many
    options to consider. Failing to set these options appropriately may reduce the usefulness and value of the resulting
    Test Logs and other outputs. Where possible, you should try to store these tool options and settings, so that they can
    be reloaded easily based on one or more predetermined profiles. In the case of automated test execution tools, there
    may be many different settings to be considered, such as the speed at which execution should be performed.
</p>
<p>
    In the case of manual testing, it is often simply a matter of logging into issue or change request tracking systems, or
    partitioning a new unique entry in a support system for logging results. You should give some thought to concerns such
    as the name, location, and state of the Test Log to be written to.

<div class="stepHeading">Schedule Test Suite Execution</div>
<div class="stepContent">
<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    In many cases where test execution can be attended, the Test Suite can be executed relatively on demand. In these
    cases, scheduling will likely need to take into account considerations such as the work of other testers, other team
    members, as well as different test teams that share the test environment. In these cases, test execution will typically
    need to work around infrequent environment resets.
</p>
<p>
    However, in cases where unattended execution of automated tests is desired, or where the execution of many tests
    running concurrently on different machines must be coordinated, some form of automated scheduling mechanism may be
    required. Either use the features of your automated test execution tool, or develop your own utility functions to
    enable the required scheduling.

    Executing the Test Suite will vary depending upon whether testing is conducted automatically or manually. In either

        Test Logs from which subsequent Test Results are derived may be unreliable. The cause of the abnormal termination
        needs to be identified and, if necessary, the fault corrected and the tests re-executed.

<div class="stepContent">
<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    When test execution initially completes, you should review the Test Logsto ensure that the logs are reliable, and that
    reported failures, warnings, or unexpected results were not caused by external (to the target-of-test) influences (such
    as improper environment setup or invalid input data for the test).
</p>
<p>
    For GUI-driven automated Tests, common Test failures include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Test verification failures:</b> This occurs when the actual result and the expected result do not match. Verify
        that the verification method(s) used focus only on the essential items or properties, and modify if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Unexpected GUI windows:</b> This occurs for several reasons. The most common is when a GUI window other than the
        expected one is active, or the number of displayed GUI windows is greater than expected. Ensure that the test
        environment has been set up and initialized as intended for proper test execution.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Missing GUI windows:</b> This failure is noted when a GUI window is expected to be available (but not
        necessarily active) and is not. Ensure that the test environment has been set up and initialized as intended for
        proper test execution. Verify that the actual missing windows are or were removed from the target-of-test.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the reported failures are due to errors identified in the test work products, or due to problems with the test
    environment, the appropriate corrective action should be taken and the testing re-executed.
</p>
<p>
    If the Test Log enables you to determine that the failures are due to genuine failures in the Target Test Items, then
    the execution portion of the task is complete.

    some form of basic environment reset (for example, Registry and other configuration files), restoration of underlying
    databases to a known state, and so on, in addition to tasks such as loading paper into printers. While some tasks can
    be performed automatically, some aspects typically require human attention.

<div class="stepContent">
<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    Using the Traceability requirements for your project, update the traceability relationships as required. A good
    starting point is to consider traceability in terms of measuring the extent of testing or test coverage. As a general
    rule, base the measurement of the extent of testing against the motivators that you discovered during the test planning
    activities.
</p>
<p>
    Test Suites might also be traced to the defined Test Cases that they realize. They may also be traced to elements of
    the requirements, software specification, design, or implementation.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever relationships you have decided are important to trace, you will need to update the status of the relationships
    that were established during implementation of the Test Suite.

    You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and that it is complete enough to be useful to those

</p>
<p>
    Have the people who perform the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input review your interim work. Do this
    while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate your work
    against the key input work products to make sure that you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It may be
    useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.

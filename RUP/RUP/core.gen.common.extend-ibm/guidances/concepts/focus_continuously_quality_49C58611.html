<h4>
    Discussion&nbsp;
</h4>
<p>
    Improving quality is not simply "meeting requirements," or producing a product that meets user needs and expectations.
    Rather, quality also includes identifying the measures and criteria that demonstrate its achievement, as well as the
    implementation of a process to ensure that the product has achieved the desired degree of quality, and that this can be
    repeated and managed.
</p>
<p>
    Ensuring high quality requires more than the participation of the testing team; it requires that <em>the entire team
    owns quality</em>. It involves all team members and all parts of the lifecycle:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Analysts</strong> are responsible for making sure that requirements are testable, and that we specify
            clear requirements for the tests to be performed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Developers</strong> need to design applications with testing in mind, and must be responsible for
            testing their code.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Managers</strong> needs to ensure that the right test plans are in place, and that the right resources
            are in place for building the testware and performing required tests.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Testers</strong> are the quality experts. They guide the rest of the team in understanding software
            quality issues, and they are responsible&nbsp;all product testing (including functional, system, and
            performance).
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    When we experience a quality issue, every team member should be willing to chip in to address the issue.
</p>
<p>
    One of the major benefits of&nbsp;<strong>Iterative Development</strong> is that it enables a <em>test early and
    continuously</em> approach, as illustrated below. By the time we reach the end of a project, and since the most
    important capabilities are implemented early on, the most essential software may&nbsp;will have&nbsp;been up and
    running for months, and it is therefore likely&nbsp;it will&nbsp;have been tested for months. It is&nbsp;no surprise
    that most projects adopting iterative development claim that an increase in quality is a primary tangible result of the
    improved process.

</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Testing Is Initiated Early and Expanded Upon in Each Iteration</strong><br />
    <em>Iterative development enables early testing. Software&nbsp;developed in each iteration is tested as it is built.
    Regression testing ensures that new defects are not introduced as new iterations add functionality. Reference:</em>
    <em>Supporting Material: Quality Management</em><em>.</em>
</p>
<p>
    As we incrementally build our application, we should also <em>incrementally build test automation</em> to detect
    defects early, while minimizing up-front investments. As we design our system, we consider how it should be tested.
    Making the right design decisions can greatly improve our ability to automate testing. We may also be able to generate
    test code directly from the design models. This saves time, provides incentives for early testing, and increases the
    quality of testing by minimizing the number of bugs in the test software. Automated testing has been a key area of
    focus for, among others, the agile community, where the aim is to automate testing of all code, and where tests are
    written before the code is written (test-first design.)

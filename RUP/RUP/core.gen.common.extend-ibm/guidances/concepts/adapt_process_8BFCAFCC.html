                    This principle states that it is critical to right-size the development process to the needs of the
                    project. More is not better, less is not better: Instead, the amount of ceremony, precision, and
                    control present in a project must be tailored according to a variety of factors including the size and
                    distribution of teams, the amount of externally imposed constraints, and the phase the project is in.

<h4>
    Discussion
</h4>
<p>
    More process, such as usage of more artifacts, production of more detailed documentation, development and maintenance
    of more models that need to be synchronized, and more formal reviews, is not necessarily better. Rather, <em>we need to
    right-size the process to project needs</em>. As a project grows in size, becomes more distributed, uses more complex
    technology, has larger number of stakeholders, and needs to adhere to more stringent compliance standards, the process
    needs to become more disciplined. But, for smaller projects with co-located teams and known technology, the process
    should be more lightweight.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img alt="Summary of how to customize a development process as a function of its characteristics"     src="./../../../core.gen.common.extend-ibm/guidances/concepts/resources/bp_fig1.gif" />
</p>
<p align="center">
    <em><strong>Factors driving the amount of process discipline</strong>.</em><br />
    <em>Many factors determine how disciplined the process must be, including project size, team distributions, complexity
    of technology, number of stakeholders, compliance requirements, and position in the project lifecycle.</em>
</p>
<p>
    A project should <em>adapt process ceremony to lifecycle phase</em>. In the beginning of the project on the one hand,
    we are usually faced with a lot of uncertainty, and we must&nbsp;strongly encourage creativity to develop an
    application that addresses business needs.&nbsp;More process typically leads to less creativity, not more; we
    must&nbsp;therefore&nbsp; minimize process in the early stages of a project where uncertainty is an every day factor.
    Late in the project, on the other hand, we&nbsp;will&nbsp;need to introduce more control, such as change control
    boards, to prevent undesired creativity and associated risk, which often leads to&nbsp;the late introduction of defects
    into the product: This translates to more process.
</p>
<p>
    An organization should strive to <em>continuously improve the process.</em> Consider performing an assessment after
    each iteration and at project end&nbsp;to capture lessons learned, and leverage that knowledge to improve the process.
    Encourage all team members to continuously look for opportunities to improve.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, it is critical to <em>balance project plans and associated estimates with the uncertainty of a project</em>.
    This means that, early in projects, when uncertainty is typically large, plans and associated estimates will focus on
    big-picture planning and estimates, rather than aiming at providing high levels of precision when there is in fact
    none. Early development activities should aim at driving out uncertainty to gradually enable increased precision in
    planning.

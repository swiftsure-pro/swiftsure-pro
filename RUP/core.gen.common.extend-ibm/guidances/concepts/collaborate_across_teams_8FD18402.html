<h4>
    Discussion&nbsp;
</h4>
<p>
    Software is produced by talented and motivated people collaborating closely. Many complex systems require the
    collaboration of a number of stakeholders with varying skills, and the largest projects often span geographical and
    temporal boundaries, further adding complexity to the development process. This is why people issues and collaboration
    -- what some have referred to as the "soft" element of software development -- have been a primary focus in the agile
    development community . Following this principle requires answering&nbsp;many questions, including:
</p>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            How do we motivate people to perform at their best?
        </li>
        <li>
            How do we collaborate within a co-located versus a distributed software team?
        </li>
        <li>
            How do we collaborate across teams responsible for the business, software development, and IT operations?
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p>
    The first step in effective collaboration is to <em>motivate individuals on the team to perform at their best.</em> The
    notion of self-managed teams has gained popularity in the agile community; it is based on making a team commit to what
    they should deliver and then providing that team&nbsp;with the authority to decide on all the issues directly
    influencing the result. When people feel that they are truly responsible for the end result, they are much more
    motivated to do a good job. As the agile manifesto states: "Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the
    environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done."
</p>
<p>
    The second step is to <em>encourage cross-functional collaboration</em>. As Walker Royce says, "software development is
    a team sport." An iterative approach increases the need for working closely as a team. We need to break down the walls
    that often exist between analysts, developers, and testers, and broaden the responsibilities of these roles to ensure
    effective collaboration in an environment with fast churn. Each member needs to understand the mission and vision of
    the project.
</p>
<p>
    As teams grow, we need to <em>provide then with effective collaborative environments</em>. These environments
    facilitate and automate metrics collection and status reporting, and automate build management and bookkeeping around
    configuration management. This efficiency reduces the need for meetings, which frees up team members to spend more time
    on more productive and creative activities. These environments should also enable more effective collaboration by
    simplifying communication, bridging gaps in place and time between various team members. Examples of such environment
    range from shared project rooms, to networked or Web-based solutions such as Wikis or integrated development
    environments and configuration and change management environments.
</p>
<p>
    As software becomes more critical to core business processes, the need for effective collaboration between teams
    increases. In most organizations the teams responsible for running the business, developing the applications, and
    running the applications have poor communication.
</p>
<p>
    Our ultimate goal under this principle is <em>integrated collaboration across business, software, and operation
    teams.</em> As software becomes increasingly critical to how we run our business, we need to create close collaboration
    between 1) the teams deciding how to run our current and future business, 2) the teams developing the supporting
    software systems, and 3) the teams running our IT operations. In most companies, these three groups have poor
    communication.

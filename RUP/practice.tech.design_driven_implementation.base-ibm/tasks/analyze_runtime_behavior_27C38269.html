    The purpose of this&nbsp;step is to identify the execution path that will stimulate the desired runtime behavior.
</div>
<p>
    If the observation and analysis of runtime behavior is to provide the desired insight into the behavior of the
    software, you will need to give consideration to which execution paths through the application will be of importance to
    explore and of those, which will offer the most opportunity in understanding the runtime behavior of the software.
</p>
<p>
    In general, the most useful scenarios to explore tend to reflect all or part of those that the user will typically use.
    As such, it is useful wherever possible to identify scenarios by questioning or otherwise consulting with a domain
    expert such as a representative user of the software being developed.
</p>
<p>
    Use cases offer a valuable set of artifacts from which useful scenarios can be identified and explored. As a developer,
    the most familiar of these will likely be the use-case realizations which you should begin with if available. In the
    absence of use-case realizations, identify any available use-case scenarios that offer a textual explanation of the
    path the user will navigate through the various flows of events in the use case. Finally, the use-case flows of events
    can be consulted to provide information from which likely candidate scenarios can be identified. The success of this
    last approach is improved by consultation with a representative for the uses cases actor or other domain expert.
</p>
<p>
    Testers are another useful resource to consult when attempting to identify useful scenarios for runtime analysis.
    Testers often have insight into and experience with the domain through their testing efforts that evolves them into
    pseudo-domain experts. In many cases, the stimulus for observing the software's runtime behavior will come from the
    results of the testing effort itself.
</p>
<p>
    If this task is driven by a reported defect, the main focus will be to reproduce it in a controlled environment. Based
    on the information which has been logged when the problem happened, a number of test case have to be identified as
    potential candidates for making the defect occur reliably. You might need to tweak some of the tests or write new ones,
    but keep in mind that reproducing the defect is an essential step and for the most difficult cases it will take more
    time to stabilize the defect than to fix it.

<p>
    The purpose of this step is to ensure the component is ready in an appropriate state to enable runtime execution.
</p>
<p>
    For runtime execution of the component to yield accurate results, care should be taken to prepare the component
    satisfactorily so that no anomalous results occur as a by-product of errors in implementation, compilation or linking.
</p>
<p>
    It is often necessary to make use of stubs so that the runtime observation can be completed in a timely manner, or so
    that it can actually be conducted in situations where the component is reliant on other components that have not yet
    been implemented.
</p>
<p>
    You will also need to prepare any framework or supporting tools required to execute the component. In some cases this
    may mean creating driver or harness code to support execution of the component; in other cases it may mean
    instrumenting the component so that external support tools can observe and possibly control the components behavior.

<p>
    The purpose of this step is to ensure the prerequisite setup of the target environment has been completed
    satisfactorily.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to consider any requirements and constraints that must be addressed for the target environment in which
    the runtime analysis will occur. In some cases it will be necessary to simulate one or more of the intended deployment
    environments in which the component will ultimately be required to run. In other cases, it will be sufficient to
    perform the observe the runtime behavior on the developers machine.
</p>
<p>
    In any case, it is important to setup the target environment for the runtime observation satisfactorily so that the
    exercise is not wasted by the inclusion of "contaminants" that will potentially invalidate the subsequent analysis.
</p>
<p>
    Another consideration is the use of tools that generate environmental constraints or exception conditions that are
    otherwise difficult to reproduce. Such tools are invaluable in isolating failures or anomalies that occur in runtime
    behavior under these conditions.

    Having prepared both the component and the environment it will be observed in, you can now begin to execute the

    The purpose of this step is to verify that the task has been completed appropriately and that the resulting work
    products are acceptable.
</p>
<p>
    Now that you have completed the work, it is a good practice to verify that the work was of sufficient value. You should
    evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members
    who will make subsequent use of it as input to their work. Where possible, use the checklists provided in RUP to verify
    that quality and completeness are "good enough".
</p>
<p>
    Have the people who will use your work as input in performing their downstream tasks take part in reviewing your
    interim work. Do this while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also
    evaluate your work against the key input work products to make sure you have represented or considered them
    sufficiently and accurately. It may be useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this
    basis.
</p>
<p>
    Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative delivery process and that in many cases work products evolve over time.
    As such, it is not usually necessary-and is in many cases counterproductive-to fully-form a work product that will only
    be partially used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent downstream work. This is because there is a high
    probability that the situation surrounding the work product will change-and the assumptions made when the work product
    was created proven incorrect-before the work product is used, resulting in rework and therefore wasted effort.
</p>
<p>
    Also avoid the trap of spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of the value of the content itself. In
    project environments where presentation has importance and economic value as a project deliverable, you might want to
    consider using an administrative or junior resource to perform work on a work product to improve its presentation.

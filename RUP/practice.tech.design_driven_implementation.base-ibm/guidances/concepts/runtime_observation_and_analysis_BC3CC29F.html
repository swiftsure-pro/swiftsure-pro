<p>
    The observation and subsequent analysis of the runtime behavior of a software component is an important practice in the
    successful debugging of software. Understanding the runtime behavior of software involves two key practices:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Observation of the software during runtime execution.
    </li>
    <li>
        Analysis of the captured observations.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Runtime observation and analysis techniques are themselves not dependent on testing in so far as runtime behavior can
    be observed and analyzed without the requirement for predefined test inputs or the use of testing techniques to
    stimulate the application behavior. However, testing can be successfully combined with runtime observation techniques
    and tools: for example, tools that automate runtime observation can be executed during test execution, improving the
    visibility into the runtime behavior of the component that occurs in response to the test.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="RuntimeObservation" name="RuntimeObservation">Observing runtime behavior</a>
</h3>
<p>
    While it is important to carefully observe all of the behavior that occurs during runtime execution of the software,
    there are usually significant observation points that are useful to specifically monitor. These significant observation
    points are often:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Decision points at which the software logic path is about to or has just branched.
    </li>
    <li>
        Completion points at which an important logic path has completed, typically resulting in a state change within the
        software environment.
    </li>
    <li>
        An interface point between two separate application components.
    </li>
    <li>
        An interface point between the software and it's execution environment, including any interfaces to hardware
        components.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These observation points may also align with control points at which it may be desirable to alter either the
    application state or the flow of control through the logic paths. These concerns are often referred to as Points of
    Control and Observation (PCO).
</p>
<p>
    Runtime observation excludes static observation methods as a primary approach, such as review of the static software
    source code or of the relationships between the software building blocks captured in visual models and so forth.
    Rather, it requires an executable software component and offers valuable information not available through other
    debugging techniques about how the developed component behaves when it runs, either in the test environment, or in the
    final deployment environment. The observations captured from the runtime behavior may subsequently be related to static
    elements to provide additional insight.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="RuntimeAnalysis" name="RuntimeAnalysis">Analyzing runtime observations</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Software runtime analysis is simply the practice of understanding the behavior of a software component by analyzing
    data collected during runtime execution of the component. During the development of the component by the developer,
    runtime observation and analysis is one aspect of the debugging activities the developer undertakes.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="AutomatedToolSupport" name="AutomatedToolSupport">Automated tool support</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Because of the potential volume of low-level information that can be captured from runtime behavior, the speed at which
    that information is generated, and the subsequent difficulty in understanding the potentially vast amount of
    information, automated tool support is a key factor in making this practice feasible. There are various approaches that
    can be taken to provide tool support yourself, and a wealth of tools available commercially that will save you the
    time, effort and cost of creating your own.

    <font size="2">In the context of services modeling, ServiceContracts&nbsp;can be used to model the specification for a
    specific service. A ServicesArchitecture&nbsp;then can be used to model the requirements for a collection of
    participants that provide and consume services defined with service contracts.</font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">When modeling the requirements for a particular service, a ServiceContract captures an
    agreement between the roles played by consumers and providers of the service, their capabilities and needs, and the
    rules for how the consumers and providers must interact. The roles in a ServiceContract are typed by Interfaces that
    specify Operations and events that comprise the choreographed interactions of the services. A ServiceInterface may
    fulfill zero or more ServiceContracts to indicate the requirements it fulfills but they are usually
    one-one.</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">Figure 1 presents an example of a ServiceContract. The orderer and order processor
    participate in the contract.</font></font>

</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">The service contract diagram shows a high level "business view" of services but includes
    ServiceInterfaces as the types of the roles to ground the business view in the required details. While two roles are
    shown in the example, a ServiceContract&nbsp;can have any number of roles. Identification of the roles can be augmented
    with a behavior, such as the one shown in Figure 2. Real-world services&nbsp;typically are long-running,
    bi-directional, and asynchronous. This real-world behavior shows the information and resources that are transferred
    between the service provider and consumer.</font></font>

</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2"><font size="2">The above behavior (a UML interaction diagram) shows when and what
    information is transferred between the parties in the service. In this case a fulfillPurchaseOrder message is sent from
    the orderer to the order processor, and the order processor eventually responds with either a shipment schedule or an
    order-rejected response. The service interfaces that correspond to the above types are shown in Figure
    3.</font></font></font>

<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">Real-world services&nbsp;often are complex and are made up of simpler services as
    "building blocks." Using services as building blocks is a good design pattern, because it can decouple finer grain
    services and make them reusable across a number of service contracts. Finer grain services&nbsp;can then be delegated
    to internal actors or components for implementation. Above is an example of a compound ServiceContract composed of
    other, nested, ServiceContracts. This pattern is common when defining enterprise level ServicesArchitectures, which
    tend to be more complex and span an extended process lifecycle. The purchasing ServiceContract is composed of 2 more
    granular ServiceContracts: the "Ordering Service" and the "Invoicing Service." The buyer is the "orderer" of the
    ordering service and the "invoice receiver" of the invoicing service. The "Seller" is the "Order processor" of the
    ordering service and the "invoicer" of the invoicing service. ServiceContracts&nbsp;can be nested to any level using
    this pattern. The purchasing service defines a new ServiceContract by piecing together these other two
    services.&nbsp;It is common in a compound service for one role to initiate a sub-service but then to be the client of
    the next.&nbsp; There is no expectation that all the services must go the same direction. This allows for long-lived,
    rich, and asynchronous interactions between participants in a service.</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">Do not confuse a compound ServiceContract&nbsp;with a service that is implemented by
    calling other services, such as might be specified with a Participant ServicesArchitecture and/or implemented with
    BPEL. A compound ServiceContract defines a more granular ServiceContract based on other ServiceContracts.</font></font>
    This is shown in Figure 5.

    ports</strong>

</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">A compound service has service interfaces with ports, each port representing its role in
    the larger service contract.&nbsp;Figure 5&nbsp;shows the Service Interfaces corresponding to the buyer and seller in
    the purchasing service, a compound service.&nbsp;The seller has two ports, each corresponding to the roles played in
    the ordering service and invoicing service. Likewise, the buyer has two ports, each corresponding to the roles it plays
    in the same services. These ports are typed by the ServiceInterfaces of the corresponding nested services. The
    purchasing service specifies how these classes work together and defines the behavioral specification required for
    each.</font></font>
</p>
<p>
    <font size="2"><font size="2">When a compound service is used, it looks no different than any other service in a
    services architecture.&nbsp; This hides the detail of the more granular service in the high-level architecture, but it
    still provides traceability through all levels.</font></font>&nbsp;

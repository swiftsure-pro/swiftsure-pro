    At the end of the elaboration phase is the second important project milestone, the <b>Lifecycle Architecture
    Milestone</b>. At this point, you examine the detailed system objectives and scope, the choice of architecture, and the
    resolution of the major risks.
</p>
<h4>
    Evaluation Criteria
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        The product Vision and requirements are stable.
    </li>
    <li>
        The architecture is stable.
    </li>
    <li>
        The key approaches to be used in test and evaluation are proven.
    </li>
    <li>
        Test and evaluation of executable prototypes have demonstrated that the major risk elements have been addressed and
        have been credibly resolved.
    </li>
    <li>
        The iteration plans for the construction phase are of sufficient detail and fidelity to allow the work to proceed.
    </li>
    <li>
        The iteration plans for the construction phase are supported by credible estimates.
    </li>
    <li>
        All stakeholders agree that the current vision can be met if the current plan is executed to develop the complete
        system, in the context of the current architecture.
    </li>
    <li>
        Actual resource expenditure versus planned expenditure is acceptable.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The project may be aborted or considerably re-thought if it fails to reach this milestone.

<h4>
    <a id="The Role of Prototyping" name="The Role of Prototyping">The Role of Prototyping</a>
</h4>
<p>
    The Rational Unified Process gives the software architect and project manager the freedom to construct prototypes of
    several types as a risk reduction strategy. Some of these prototypes may be purely exploratory, and are subsequently
    discarded. However, it is likely (certainly for larger or unprecedented systems) that the architecture will have been
    constructed as a series of evolutionary prototypes-covering different issues as elaboration proceeds-and by the end of
    elaboration, will have culminated in an integrated, stable architectural base. We do not mean to suggest here that the
    prototyping effort during elaboration should result in a set of architectural fragments, which need not be
    integrated.<br />

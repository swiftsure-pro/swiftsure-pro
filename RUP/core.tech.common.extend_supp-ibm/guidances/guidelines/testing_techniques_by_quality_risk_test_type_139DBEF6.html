<p>
    The databases and the database processes should be tested as an independent subsystem. This testing should test the
    subsystems without the target-of-test's User Interface as the interface to the data. Additional research into the
    Database Management System (DBMS) needs to be performed to identify the tools and techniques that may exist to support
    the testing identified in the following table.

</h3>
<p>
    Function testing of the target-of-test should focus on any requirements for test that can be traced directly to use
    cases or business functions and business rules. The goals of these tests are to verify proper data acceptance,
    processing, and retrieval, and the appropriate implementation of the business rules. This type of testing is based upon
    black box techniques; that is, verifying the application and its internal processes by interacting with the application
    via the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and analyzing the output or results. The following table identifies an outline
    of the testing recommended for each application.

<p>
    User Interface (UI) testing verifies a user's interaction with the software. The goal of UI testing is to ensure that
    the UI provides the user with the appropriate access and navigation through the functions of the target-of-test. In
    addition, UI testing ensures that the objects within the UI function as expected and conform to corporate, or industry,
    standards.

<p>
    Load testing is a performance test that subjects the target-of-test to varying workloads to measure and evaluate the
    performance behaviors and abilities of the target-of-test to continue to function properly under these different
    workloads. The goal of load testing is to determine and ensure that the system functions properly beyond the expected
    maximum workload. Additionally, load testing evaluates the performance characteristics, such as response times,
    transaction rates, and other time-sensitive issues.

    Stress Testing</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Stress testing is a type of performance test implemented and executed to understand how a system fails due to
    conditions at the boundary, or outside of, the expected tolerances. This typically involves low resources or
    competition for resources. Low resource conditions reveal how the target-of-test fails that is not apparent under
    normal conditions. Other defects might result from competition for shared resources, like database locks or network
    bandwidth, although some of these tests are usually addressed under functional and load testing.

    Volume Testing</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Volume testing subjects the target-of-test to large amounts of data to determine if limits are reached that cause the
    software to fail. Volume testing also identifies the continuous maximum load or volume the target-of-test can handle
    for a given period. For example, if the target-of-test is processing a set of database records to generate a report, a
    Volume Test would use a large test database, and would check that the software behaved normally and produced the
    correct report.

</h3>
<p>
    Security and Access Control Testing focuses on two key areas of security:
</p>
<p>
    Application-level security, including access to the Data or Business Functions
</p>
<p>
    System-level Security, including logging into or remotely accessing to the system
</p>
<p>
    Based on the security you want, application-level security ensures that actors are restricted to specific functions or
    use cases, or they are limited in the data that is available to them. For example, everyone may be permitted to enter
    data and create new accounts, but only managers can delete them. If there is security at the data level, testing
    ensures that "user type one" can see all customer information, including financial data, however, "user type two" only
    sees the demographic data for the same client.
</p>
<p>
    System-level security ensures that only those users granted access to the system are capable of accessing the
    applications and only through the appropriate gateways.

</h3>
<p>
    Failover and recovery testing ensures that the target-of-test can successfully failover and recover from a variety of
    hardware, software, or network malfunctions with undue loss of data or data integrity.
</p>
<p>
    For those systems that must be kept running, failover testing ensures that when a failover condition occurs, the
    alternate or backup systems properly "take over" for the failed system without any loss of data or transactions.
</p>
<p>
    Recovery testing is an antagonistic test process in which the application or system is exposed to extreme conditions,
    or simulated conditions, to cause a failure, such as device Input/Output (I/O) failures, or invalid database pointers
    and keys. Recovery processes are invoked, and the application or system is monitored and inspected to verify proper
    application, or system, and data recovery has been achieved.

                    The tests already created for Function and Business Cycle testing can be used as a basis for creating a
                    series of transactions to support failover and recovery testing, primarily to define the tests to be
                    run to test that recovery was successful.

                    Power interruption to the client: power down the PC.

                <p>
                    Power interruption to the server: simulate or initiate power down procedures for the server.

                <p>
                    Interruption via network servers: simulate or initiate communication loss with the network (physically
                    disconnect communication wires or power down network servers or routers).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interruption, communication, or power loss to DASD and DASD controllers: simulate or physically
                    eliminate communication with one or more DASDs or DASD controllers.

                <p>
                    Once the above conditions or simulated conditions are achieved, additional transactions should be
                    executed and upon reaching this second test point state, recovery procedures should be invoked.

                <p>
                    Testing for incomplete cycles utilizes the same technique as described above except that the database
                    processes themselves should be aborted or prematurely terminated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Testing for the following conditions requires that a known database state be achieved. Several database
                    fields, pointers, and keys should be corrupted manually and directly within the database (via database
                    tools). Additional transactions should be executed using the tests from Application Function and
                    Business Cycle Testing and full cycles executed.

<p>
    Configuration testing verifies the operation of the target-of-test on different software and hardware configurations.
    In most production environments, the particular hardware specifications for the client workstations, network
    connections, and database servers vary. Client workstations may have different software loaded (for example,
    applications, drivers, and so on) and, at any one time, many different combinations may be active using different
    resources.

</h3>
<p>
    Installation testing has two purposes. The first is to ensure that the software can be installed under different
    conditions (such as a new installation, an upgrade, and a complete or custom installation) under normal and abnormal
    conditions. Abnormal conditions include insufficient disk space, lack of privilege to create directories, and so on.
    The second purpose is to verify that, once installed, the software operates correctly. This usually means running a
    number of tests that were developed for Function Testing.<b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><br     style="PAGE-BREAK-BEFORE: always" clear="all" />

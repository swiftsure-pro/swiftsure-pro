    The IT Services Strategy work product describes the desired future strategic set or portfolio of IT services that must
    be provided to satisfy the business' requirements and describes the individual services making up that future service
    portfolio or service model.
</p>
<p>
    An IT service is a specific IT function or output, performed on behalf of or in support of a consumer, that provides
    measurable value. Services are a basis for doing business with the consumer of IT services, require an understanding of
    their needs, and are delivered through a series of implemented activities.
</p>
<p>
    An IT service brings together elements of process, organization and technology. The detailed service definitions show:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The activities, from one or more processes, that are executed in delivering the service;
    </li>
    <li>
        The service roles or participants responsible for executing those activities;
    </li>
    <li>
        The tools or information technology used to automate the execution of activities and deliver their results.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The IT services strategy describes the set of services that are to be provided and the way in which those services are
    grouped or categorized. The scope and granularity of the service model will depend greatly on the perspective being
    taken and the context within which the service model and service definitions are being created. The level of detail
    necessary in the service definition will vary considerably depending on the audience for that description and the
    purpose for which it is being created. For example, the IT Service model and service definitions used by a CIO or
    business executive to facilitate analysis of outsourcing options will be at a much higher level than the service
    definitions required by the first line IT manager responsible for defining and implementing service workflows.
</p></td>

<tr valign="top">
<th class="sectionTableHeading" scope="row">Brief Outline</th><td class="sectionTableCell"><p>
    The IT Services Strategy may have several components, each of which may use a different notation.
</p>
<p>
    The IT services portfolio will generally be a textual document with supporting diagrams. It will provide a high level
    model of the service groupings or categories. It may perhaps suggest a hierarchy of service groups, services and
    service elements depending on the scope and objectives of the engagement. Typically, a context diagram that shows the
    relationships between the service groups or the hierarchy of services will accompany the textual description of the
    model.
</p>
<p>
    For the IT services which are identified as the focus of the project a textual service definition will be produced.
    There are a series of elements suggested below which may go into the service definition. Depending on the project scope
    and objectives it may not be necessary to define all these attributes of the required IT services. In subsequent stages
    of the design and implementation life cycle additional work products will be produced which will decompose the service
    portfolio and specify the services in greater detail.
</p>
<p>
    There may sometimes be a series a of interim supporting outputs that document the processes and criteria that were used
    to develop the strategic IT service portfolio and to evaluate and select between alternate solution approaches.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Service Definition - Consumer View</strong>
</p>
<p>
    From a consumer's perspective, the definition of a service should include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div>
            Name â€“ A noun/verb format is suggested, both to provide focus on the result (the noun) desired by the consumer,
            and to distinguish it from a functional process (which has a verb/noun format). Where possible, the name should
            reflect the service scope.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Description
        </div>

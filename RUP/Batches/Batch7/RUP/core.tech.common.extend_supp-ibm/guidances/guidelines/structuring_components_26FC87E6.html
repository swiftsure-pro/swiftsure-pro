    To structure your component model, assess the components according to a number of attributes. These attributes help you

    <font size="5">Cohesion</font>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Cohesion is a measure of how well a component's responsibilities are related to each other. High cohesion (components
    with closely related responsibilities) is good, while low cohesion is bad.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    An example of a highly cohesive component might be a 'Dictionary' component that has the responsibilities of checking
    spelling and performing a thesaurus function to find alternatives for words. If the 'Dictionary' component also has the
    responsibility for performing numeric arithmetic, then it exhibits low cohesion. It would be better for that
    responsibility to be dealt with by a different component. The following are seven degrees of cohesion, listed from
    highest to lowest:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">

    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">

<h3 style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt">
    <font size="5">Coupling</font>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Coupling is an indication of the strength of the associations between components. Strongly coupled components have
    tightly bound associations, and the components are highly dependent on each other. Weakly coupled components have very
    loose (or even non-existent) associations with each other.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Weakly coupled components are better than tightly coupled ones, because it is easier to switch one component for
    another, or update a component without affecting others. There are six degrees of coupling, <a id="OLE_LINK1" name="OLE_LINK1">listed following from best to worst</a>:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Data coupling</strong>: Communication is via parameters, where each parameter is an elementary piece of
            data.

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Stamp coupling</strong>: Communication is via composite data, or data with meaningful internal
            structure.

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Control coupling</strong>: Data passed is intended to control the internal logic of the component.

    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Common coupling</strong>: Components both refer to the same global data area.

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Content coupling</strong>: One component refers to the inside of another in some way; one component

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Hybrid coupling</strong>: Different meanings are assigned to different parts of a range of data. For

<h3 style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt">
    <font size="5">Isolation</font>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Isolation is a measure of the degree to which product or technology dependencies are isolated from each other. There
    are two extremes of isolation:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Bad isolation</strong>: Every component has a dependency on the product or technology of other
            components. There is little to no use of patterns that encourage isolation techniques.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Good isolation</strong>: Product and technology dependencies are fully decoupled. There is good use of
            patterns that encourage isolation techniques. Examples of such patterns include the Gang of Four "Proxy",
            "Bridge", and "Mediator" patterns and the GRASP "Indirection" pattern.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Isolation and coupling are closely related. Isolation of products and technologies ensures loose coupling. Layering is
    another approach to ensuring good isolation.
</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt">
    <font size="5">Granularity</font>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Granularity is a measure of the size, or amount of functionality, assigned to a component. There are five levels of
    granularity:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Very fine grained</strong>: For example, an object-oriented language class useful for assembling
            distributed components, but not considered a component in its own right.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Fine grained</strong>: A software element that can be called at runtime, with a clear interface and a
            separation between interface and implementation. Also known as a <i             style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">distributed component</i>.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Medium grained</strong>: An autonomous business concept, or business process. Also known as a <i             style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">business component</i>.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Coarse grained</strong>: A set of cooperating business components assembled to deliver a solution to a
            business problem. Also known as a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">system-level component</i>.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            <strong>Very course grained</strong>: For example, a federation of system-level components working together to
            provide some business value. It helps heterogeneous information systems interoperate.
        </div>
    </li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    You can think of a system-level component as the same as an application. However, one major difference is that a
    component-based system is made up of components visible at runtime. The implementation of a component can be changed
    without having to change the rest of the system. Making such changes is more difficult with large, monolithic
    applications. Different component-based systems (applications) can be assembled without necessarily having to redesign
    at the detail level, break code apart, recompile, or re-link the system.

<h3 style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in 0pt">
    <font size="5">Layering</font>
</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Layering involves:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            Identifying suitable architectural layers within which components can be placed.

    Bachmann et al [BACHMANN00] offer the following definition of layering. "<i     style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Layering, like all architectural structures, reflects a division of the software
    into units. In this case, the units are layers; each layer represents a virtual machine. A virtual machine is a
    collection of software that together provides a cohesive set of services that other software can utilize without
    knowing how those services are implemented.</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">...The goal of layering is to
    define virtual machines that are small enough to be well understood, but comprehensive enough so that likely changes
    will affect only a single layer".</i>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Layering is a mechanism for grouping a set of components according to their generality. For example, a system might
    have the following layers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            All components that provide <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">application-independent</b> business
            function. Application-independent business functions are things like customer management and product
            management, which apply to many applications.

    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            All components that provide <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">service functions</b>, such as error

    Layering offers the following benefits [BACHMANN00]:

    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            Layers help to bring quality attributes of modifiability and portability to a system. A change to a lower layer
            that does not affect its interface will not require a change to a higher layer. For example, any J2EE compliant
            application server that conforms to the J2EE standard may be freely substituted without change to
            application-level software. A change to a higher layer that does not affect what it requires from lower layers
            will not affect a lower layer. In general, changes to a layered software system that do not affect an interface
            are confined to a single layer. Thus, layers define units of reuse and portability.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            Layers are part of the blueprint role that architecture plays for constructing the system. By knowing which
            layers contains their software, developers know what services they can rely on in the coding environment.
            Layers may define work assignments for development teams.

    <li>
        <div class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
            Layers are part of the communication role played by architecture. In a large system, the number of dependencies
            among modules expands rapidly. Organizing the software into layers with interfaces is an important tool to help
            you manage complexity and communicate the structure to developers.

</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Layering can be strict or non-strict. A strict layering scheme means that components can only use components in the
    same layer, or layers, immediately below them. A non-strict layering scheme means components can use components in the
    same, or any lower layer. As a general rule, components should not use components in upper layers. If components have
    dependencies on components in higher layers, then it is difficult to replace the upper layer components without
    changing the lower layer components.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    There are many ways of layering software; Figure 2 shows one possible set of layers. You may need fewer or more layers,
    depending on the size and complexity of your system. However, avoid schemes with ten or more layers, as they may be
    overly complex.

    Layers are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">not</i> the same as tiers.  Tier pictures express allocation to
    machines in a distributed environment, data flow among elements, and the presence and utilization of communication
    channels.  These diagrams are similar to layer diagrams, but tier diagrams tend to show two-way arrows indicating
    bi-directional communication.  Bi-directional communication is discouraged in a layer diagram.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 6pt 0in">
    Furthermore, assignment of a component to a tier is defined by the required service level characteristics of the
    system.  The main difference between layer diagrams and tier diagrams is that the former has no notion of placement,
    while the latter does.  Figure 3 illustrates the differences between layers and tiers.

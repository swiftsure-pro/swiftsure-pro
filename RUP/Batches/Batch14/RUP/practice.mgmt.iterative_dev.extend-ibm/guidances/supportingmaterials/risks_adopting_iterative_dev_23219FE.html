    The table later in this topic lists the risks when adopting iterative development, the probability for the risk to
    become an issue, the potential consequences to projects and organizations, and the potential strategies to mitigate
    those risks. Most of the risks apply primarily to organizations with a traditional software development culture (which
    are considered new to iterative development), &nbsp;but some risks apply to organizations with a modern software
    development culture, as well.

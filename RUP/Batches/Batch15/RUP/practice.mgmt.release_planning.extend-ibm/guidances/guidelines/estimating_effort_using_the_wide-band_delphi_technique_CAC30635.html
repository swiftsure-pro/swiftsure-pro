<h3>
    <a id="Introduction" name="Introduction"></a>Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    This guideline describes a technique that can be used to estimate software development effort. The Wideband Delphi
    estimation method can be summarized as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Select a team of experts, and provide each with a description of the problem to be estimated.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask each expert to provide an estimate (often anonymously) of the effort, including a breakdown of the problem into
        a list of tasks, and an effort estimate for each task.
    </li>
    <li>
        The experts then collaborate, revising their estimates iteratively, until a consensus has been reached.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Using the Wideband Delphi method provides several advantages over obtaining an estimate from a single individual.
    First, it helps build a complete task list or work breakdown structure for major tasks, because each participant will
    think of tasks. The consensus approach helps eliminate bias in estimates produced by self-proclaimed experts,
    inexperienced estimators or influential individuals who have hidden agendas or divergent objectives. People are
    generally more committed to estimates they help produce than to those generated by others. No participant in an
    estimation task knows the "right" answer, and creating multiple estimates acknowledges this uncertainty. Finally, users
    of the Delphi approach recognize the value of iteration on any complex task.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Applying Wideband Delphi" name="Applying Wideband Delphi"></a>Applying Wideband Delphi
</h3>
<p>
    Wideband Delphi can be used to estimate virtually anything-the number of labor months needed to implement a specific
    subsystem, the lines of code or number of classes in an entire product, or the gallons of paint needed to redecorate
    Bill Gates' house, or the effort it would take a particular organization to achieve level two of the Capability
    Maturity Model.
</p>
<p>
    The Delphi method helps you develop a detailed work breakdown structure, which provides the foundation for bottom-up
    effort and schedule or size estimation. The starting point for a Delphi session could be a Vision document, a more
    detailed Requirements specification of the problem being estimated or an initial high-level architecture description,
    or a project schedule. The outputs are a more detailed project task list; a list of associated quality, process-related
    and overhead tasks; estimation assumptions; and a set of tasks and overall project estimates, one from each
    participant.
</p>
<p>
    Figure 1 illustrates the process flow for a Wideband Delphi session. The problem being estimated is defined and the
    participants selected during planning. The kickoff meeting gets all estimators focused on the problem. Each participant
    then individually prepares his or her initial task lists and estimates. They bring these items to the estimation
    meeting, during which several estimating cycles lead to a more comprehensive task list and a revised set of estimates.
    The moderator or project manager then consolidates the assorted estimation information offline, and the team reviews
    the estimation results. When some predetermined exit criteria are satisfied, the session is completed. The resulting
    range of estimates is likely to be a more realistic predictor of the future than any single estimate. Let's look at
    each of these process steps in turn.

    <i>When planning a Wideband Delphi session, the problem is defined and the participants selected. The kickoff meeting
    gets all estimators focused on the problem. Each participant then individually prepares initial task lists and
    estimates. During the estimation meeting, several cycles lead to a more comprehensive task list and a revised set of
    estimates. The information is then consolidated offline, and the team reviews the estimation results. When the exit
    criteria are satisfied, the session is completed.</i>
</blockquote>
<h4>
    <a id="Planning" name="Planning"></a>Planning
</h4>
<p>
    A Wideband Delphi session begins with defining and scoping the problem: vision, use case model, existing system,
    preliminary architecture. Large problems are broken down into manageable portions that can be estimated more
    accurately, perhaps by different teams. The person who initiated the estimation task assembles a problem specification
    that will give the participants enough information to produce credible, informed estimates.
</p>
<p>
    The estimation participants include a moderator, who plans and coordinates the task, the project manager and two to
    four other estimators. The moderator should be informed enough to participate as an estimator but acts as an impartial
    facilitator who won't skew the results with his or her own biases or insights. The participants are selected because
    they understand the problem or project and associated estimation issues.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="The Kickoff" name="The Kickoff"></a>The Kickoff
</h4>
<p>
    An initial kickoff meeting of up to an hour gets all participants up to speed on the estimation problem. The moderator
    explains Wideband Delphi to team members who are unfamiliar with it and supplies the other estimators with the problem
    specification and any assumptions or project constraints. The moderator strives to give the estimators enough
    information to do a good job without unduly influencing their estimates.
</p>
<p>
    The team reviews the estimation objectives and discusses the problem and any estimation issues. The participants agree
    on the estimation units they will use, such as weeks, labor hours, dollars or lines of code. If the moderator concludes
    that all team members are sufficiently knowledgeable to contribute to the estimation task, the group is ready to roll.
    Otherwise, the participants may need to be briefed more fully on the problem they're estimating, or possibly replaced
    by others who can generate more accurate estimates.
</p>
<p>
    To determine whether you're ready to proceed with the Wideband Delphi session, check your entry criteria-that is, the
    prerequisites that must be satisfied for you to proceed with subsequent process steps. Before you dive into the
    estimation exercise, ensure that the following conditions are satisfied:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Appropriate team members have been selected.
    </li>
    <li>
        The kickoff meeting has been held.
    </li>
    <li>
        The participants have agreed on the estimation goal and units.
    </li>
    <li>
        The project manager can participate in the session.
    </li>
    <li>
        The estimators have the information they need to participate effectively.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <a id="Individual Preparation" name="Individual Preparation"></a>Individual Preparation
</h4>
<p>
    Let's assume that you wish to estimate the total amount of work effort (typically expressed in labor hours) needed to
    complete a certain project. The estimation process begins with each participant independently developing an initial
    list of the tasks that will have to be completed to reach the stated project goal, using a form like that shown in
    Figure 2. Each participant then estimates the effort each task will consume. Break each task down into tasks that are
    small enough to estimate accurately. State the tasks clearly, because someone will have to merge all of the participant
    task lists into a single composite list. Total the estimates you produce for each project task, in the agreed-upon
    units, to generate your initial overall estimate.
</p>
<div align="center">
    <img alt="Chart showing sample Delphi estimation form" src="./../../../practice.mgmt.release_planning.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/wbimg4.jpg" />
</div>
<blockquote>
    <i>The estimation process begins with each participant independently using this form to develop an initial list of the
    tasks that will have to be completed to reach the stated project goal.</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Your estimate should have no relationship to the answer you think the project manager or other stakeholders want to
    hear. There's a good chance the estimate will fall outside the acceptable project bounds of schedule, effort or cost, a
    situation that demands negotiation and might lead to scope reduction, schedule extension or resource adjustments. But
    don't let outside pressure sway your best projection of how the project will play out.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to identifying the project tasks, separately record any tasks for related or supporting tasks. Do not
    forgot to list tasks dealing with management, configuration management and process-related tasks on the first cycle. Be
    sure to include rework tasks following testing or inspection tasks. Reworking to correct defects is a fact of life, so
    you should plan for it. If you're estimating a schedule, also think of any overhead tasks that aren't specific to the
    project that you might have to build into your planning. These include meetings, vacation, training, other project
    assignments and myriad other things that suck time out of your day.
</p>
<p>
    Since radically different assumptions can lead to wide estimate variations, record any assumptions you made while
    preparing your estimates. For example, if you assumed that you will purchase a specific component library or reuse one
    from a previous project, write that down. Another estimator might assume that the project will develop that library,
    which will lead to a mismatch between your two overall estimates.
</p>
<p>
    Keep the following estimation guidelines in mind:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Assume one person (you) will perform all tasks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assume all tasks will be performed sequentially; don't worry about sequencing and predecessor tasks at this time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Assume that you can devote uninterrupted effort to each task (this may seem absurdly optimistic, but it simplifies
        the estimation process).
    </li>
    <li>
        In units of calendar time, list any known waiting times you expect to encounter between tasks. This will help you
        translate effort estimates into schedule estimates later on.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    <a id="Estimation Meeting" name="Estimation Meeting"></a>Estimation Meeting
</h4>
<p>
    The moderator begins the estimation meeting by collecting the participants' individual estimates and creating a chart
    such as Figure 3. Each participant's total project estimate is shown as an X on the "Round 1" line. Each estimator can
    see where his or her initial value fits along the spectrum. The initial estimates probably will cover a frighteningly
    large range. Just imagine the different conclusions you might have collected had you asked just one of the participants
    for his or her estimate and used that to plan the project.
</p>
<div align="center">

    participant's total project estimate is shown as an X on the "Round 1" line. The initial estimates probably will cover
    a frighteningly large range.&nbsp;</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In some organization, the moderator does not identify who created each estimate; they feel this anonymity is an
    important aspect of the Delphi technique. Anonymity prevents an outspoken colleague from intimidating the other
    participants into seeing things his or her way. It also means team members are less likely to defer to the most
    respected participant's judgment when their own analyses lead to different conclusions. But this is not a must.
</p>
<p>
    Each estimator reads his initial task list, identifying any assumptions made and raising any questions or issues,
    without revealing which estimate was his. Each participant will have listed different tasks that need to be performed.
    Combining these individual task lists leads to a more complete list than any single estimator is likely to produce.
    This approach will work for up to several dozen individual tasks. If you have more tasks than that, they might be too
    detailed. You may want to break the problem into several subproblems and estimate them individually.
</p>
<p>
    During this initial discussion, the team members also talk about their assumptions, estimation issues and questions
    they have about the problem. As a result, the team will begin to converge on a shared set of assumptions and a common
    task list. Retain this final task list to use as a starting point the next time you must estimate a similar project.
</p>
<p>
    After this initial discussion, all participants modify their estimates concurrently (and silently) in the meeting room.
    They might revise their task lists based on the information shared during the discussion, and they'll adjust individual
    task estimates based on their new understanding of the task scope or changed assumptions. All estimators can add new
    tasks to their forms and note any changes they wish to make to their initial task estimates. The net change for all
    tasks equals the change in that participant's overall project estimate.
</p>
<p>
    The moderator collects the revised overall estimates and plots them on the same chart, on the "Round 2" line. I've done
    this on a whiteboard for easy visibility. As Figure 4 illustrates, the second round might lead to a narrower
    distribution of estimates centered around a higher mean than the mean of the Round 1 values. Additional rounds should
    further narrow the distribution. The cycle of revising the task list, discussing issues and assumptions and preparing
    new estimates continues until the following conditions are met:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        you have completed four rounds
    </li>
    <li>
        the estimates have converged to an acceptably narrow range (defined in advance)
    </li>
    <li>
        the allotted meeting time was met (typically two hours)
    </li>
    <li>
        all participants are unwilling to alter their latest estimates
    </li>
</ul>
<div align="center">
    <img alt="Estimation chart showing three rounds from a Wideband Delphi session." src="./../../../practice.mgmt.release_planning.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/resources/wbimg8.jpg" />

    <i>After discussion of the initial estimates, all participants modify their estimates. The moderator collects the
    revised overall estimates and plots them on the same chart, on the "Round 2" line. These later rounds might lead to a
    narrower distribution of estimates centered around a higher mean than the mean of the Round 1 values.&nbsp;</i>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The moderator keeps the group on track, time-boxing discussions to 15 or 20 minutes to avoid endless rambling. The
    moderator should follow effective meeting facilitation practices, such as starting and ending on time, encouraging all
    participants to contribute and maintaining an impartial and non-judgmental environment. While preserving the anonymity
    of individual estimates is important for the first couple of rounds, the team members might agree at some point to put
    all their cards on the table and reach closure through an open discussion. This gives them a chance to discuss tasks
    for which their estimates vary substantially. Otherwise, though, the moderator should not identify the individual who
    produced each final estimate until the session is completed.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Assembling Tasks" name="Assembling Tasks"></a>Assembling Tasks
</h4>
<p>
    The work isn't done when the estimation meeting concludes. Either the moderator or the project manager assembles the
    project tasks and their individual estimates into a single master task list. This person also merges the individual
    lists of assumptions, quality- and process-related tasks, overhead tasks and wait times.
</p>
<p>
    The merging process involves removing duplicate tasks and reaching some reasonable resolution of different estimates
    for individual tasks. "Reasonable" doesn't mean replacing the team's estimates with values the project manager prefers.
    Large estimate differences for apparently similar tasks might indicate that estimators interpreted that task in
    different ways. For example, two people might both have an task called "implement a class." However, one estimator
    might have included unit testing and code review in the task, while the other meant just the coding effort. All
    estimators should define their tasks clearly to minimize confusion during this merging step. The merging step should
    retain the estimate range for each task, but if one estimator's task estimate was wildly different from that of the
    other estimators, understand it and then perhaps discard or modify it.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Review Results" name="Review Results"></a>Review Results
</h4>
<p>
    In the final step, the estimation team reviews the summarized results and reaches agreement on the final outcome. The
    project manager provides the other estimators with the overall task list, individual estimates, cumulative estimates,
    assumption list and any other information. Bring the team back together for a 30- to 60-minute review meeting to bring
    closure to the estimation task. This meeting also provides an opportunity for the team to contemplate this execution of
    the Wideband Delphi process and suggest ways it can be improved for future applications.
</p>
<p>
    The participants should make sure the final task list is as complete as possible. They might have thought of additional
    tasks since the estimation meeting, which could be added to the task list now. Check to see whether tasks that had
    wildly different individual estimates have been merged in a sensible way. The ultimate objective is to produce an
    estimate range that allows the project manager and other key stakeholders to proceed with project planning and
    execution at an acceptable confidence level.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Completing the Estimation" name="Completing the Estimation"></a>Completing the Estimation
</h4>
<p>
    The estimation process is completed when specified exit criteria are satisfied, at which point you can declare victory
    and move on with your life. Typical Wideband Delphi exit criteria are that:
</p>The overall task list has been assembled. 
<p>
    You have a summarized list of estimating assumptions.
</p>
<p>
    The estimators have reached consensus on how their individual estimates were synthesized into a single set with an
    acceptable range.
</p>
<p>
    Now you must decide what to do with the data. You could simply average the final estimates to come up with a single
    point estimate, which is what the person who requested the estimate probably wants to hear. However, a simple average
    is likely to be too low, and there's merit in retaining the estimate range. Estimates are predictions of the future,
    and the range reflects the inherent uncertainty of gazing into the crystal ball. You might present three numbers: the
    average of the estimates as the planned case, the minimum value as the best case and the maximum as the worst case. Or
    you could present the average value as the nominal expected outcome, plus the maximum-minus-the-average value, and
    minus the average-minus-the-minimum value.
</p>
<p>
    Each estimate has a certain probability of coming true, so a set of estimates forms a probability distribution. In
    Chapter 6 of A Discipline for Software Engineering (Addison-Wesley, 1995), Watts Humphrey describes a mathematically
    precise way to combine multiple estimates and their uncertainties to generate an overall estimate with upper and lower
    prediction intervals. Another sophisticated approach is to perform a Monte Carlo simulation to generate a probability
    distribution of possible estimate outcomes based on the final estimate values.
</p>
<p>
    While the results of a Delphi session might not be what the movers and shakers want to hear, they can decide whether
    they want to plan their project at a 10 percent confidence level, a 90 percent confidence level or somewhere
    in-between. Be sure to compare the actual project results to your estimates to improve your future estimating accuracy.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Doing It Again" name="Doing It Again"></a>Doing It Again (Iterating)
</h3>
<p>
    One nice aspect of this method is that after an initial and rather rough estimate done for example during inception,
    the estimates can be refined at each phase (or even at each iteration). The process can be faster if the same
    estimators are available, starting where they left at the previous estimation cycle. More information about the problem
    is available, some assumptions have been modified, an architecture is in place to help break down the effort.
</p>
<p>
    The new estimate may have a narrower range, but is not necessarily within the range of the previous one: it may be
    higher, or smaller. If higher, there is a clear risk signal to the project manager, risk that must be tackled at once.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Wideband Delphi Evaluated" name="Wideband Delphi Evaluated"></a>Wideband Delphi Evaluated
</h3>
<p>
    No estimation method is perfect; if it were, it would be called prediction, not estimation. However, the Wideband
    Delphi technique incorporates some solid estimating principles. The team approach acknowledges the value of combining
    multiple expert perspectives. The range of estimates produced reflects the variability intrinsic to the estimation
    process.
</p>
<p>
    Although it takes time and requires a panel of experienced estimators, Wideband Delphi removes some of the politics
    from estimation and filters out extreme initial values.

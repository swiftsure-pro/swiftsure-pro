<div class="sectionHeading">Key Considerations</div>
<div class="sectionContent">
<table class="sectionTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    Right from the start of the project, the participant training should be a focus area. Appoint one person to be
    responsible for all the activities concerning the planning of the rollout:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Select the right strategy and stick to it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Give the participant education and training a high priority, and get the best people on board.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            Introduce the instructors gradually to the plan well before the Train-the-Trainer class, so they have time to
            digest all the information.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the education and training plan is changed in the middle of rolling out the classes, consider using available
    communication channels, sending out flyers, and updated material explaining what and where the changes are.
</p>
<p>
    User profiles and authorizations may need to be set up in the training system. Coordinate this work with the team
    assigned for defining and setting up the profiles and authorizations in the production system. (During the training the
    participants may be using special training user IDs, but the user profiles (with authorization/access) should be the
    same as they will use after going live).
</p>
<p>
    If education and training is to be delivered in several languages, consider how translation is to be handled and what
    is the best way of organizing the material. Be realistic about the time needed for the translation of the material (it
    takes longer than you think!)
</p>
<p>
    As the project progresses keep the participants informed about the plans for their training. This will help prepare
    them for the training and cut down on the time needed on the course for extraneous topics.
</p>
<p>
    The planned lengths of the time for the training modules may need to be adjusted as the material is developed.
</p>
<p>
    The business benefits of the initiative can only be realized if the user community is educated in the new systems and
    processes and adopts the desired behaviors. Therefore the objectives of the education and training program are to
    provide the users with the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        sufficient skills and knowledge to operate effectively in the new environment
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            support and encouragement to adopt the required behaviors and attitudes
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div>
            well targeted and delivered education and training courses.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Education and training courses will have been successful if participants are able to meet their job performance
    requirements. These requirements will be a subset of the overall business requirements of the initiative. Therefore it
    is important to keep in mind the business reasons for implementing the change at all times when planning the training.
    All the training material should be focused on enabling the participant to contribute to these goals.

    If many users are involved, the rollout of education and training is also complicated enough to need detailed planning.

    If training is not being provided the Education and Training Plan is not required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    If the number of participants is limited and if they have been closely associated with the development effort, a
    detailed plan may not be necessary. Users will gradually gain most of the necessary knowledge during the
    implementation. However, a high level agreed-upon plan must still be created and communicated. In addition, a wrap-up
    session may still be beneficial.

    Purpose
</h3>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    Risk is a concern that has some probability of negatively impacting release commitments (such as schedule and cost) or
    the quality of the solution. Addressing risks associated with project elements such as use cases or components
    according to their likelihood of occurrence and potential impact is essential for project health.
</p>
<p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir="ltr">
    Monitoring risk distribution provides several benefits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Drives iteration plans. Use Cases and components that have associated risk with the highest probability of
        occurring and highest potential impact should be implemented first.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provides an easily understood summary of risk exposure for each element that could impact project success. New and
        escalating risks are visible.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reduces the likelihood of focusing on the wrong issues early in the lifecycle that can result in large surprises at
        the end of the project. Encourages ongoing and active mitigation efforts and increased communication.
    </li>
    <li>
        Useful for explaining the team's confidence in their estimates based on remaining uncertainty. Helps describe the
        predictability of the project based on remaining risk.
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Helps the team understand the effectiveness of their risk mitigation activities
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Definition
</h3>
<p>
    To calculate Risk Distribution:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Analyze risk and assign the following values to each project element (e.g. use case, component)
    </li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            Likelihood of occurrence - defined as a percentage. Use a standard scale such as 20% (low likelihood of
            occurrence), 40%, 60%, 80% (high likelihood of occurrence)
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
            Estimated Cost of Impact - defined in hours or days
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    2. Calculate a risk exposure score for each project element
</p>
<p>
    Risk Score = Likelihood of occurrence * Estimated Cost of Impact
</p>
<h3>
    Analysis
</h3>
<p>
    Generate a Risk Distribution report prior to iteration planning. Identify&nbsp;project elements&nbsp;with the highest
    risk scores and determine what activities are required (for example:&nbsp;get clarification from stakeholders in order
    to detail those use cases and address any uncertainties). If Risk Distribution is based on components, identify those
    with the highest risk scores in order to prioritize architectural analysis efforts to make sure those solution
    components can work as needed to meet stakeholders needs.
</p>
<h3>
    Frequency and reporting
</h3>
<p>
    The Risk Distribution report is reviewed in each iteration planning session. The team should adjust risk levels at the
    end of each iteration during a retrospective meeting. Risk Scores are adjusted as needed, and risks that have been
    addressed are closed so that the team can update the Risk Distribution chart. Stakeholders are routinely apprised of
    current risks and collaborate with the team for impact assessment and mitigation.<br />
</p>
<h3>
    Collection and reporting tools
</h3>
<p>
    Risks can be captured in IBM&reg; Rational&reg; Team Concert&reg;,&nbsp;IBM&reg; Rational&reg; Project Conductor&reg;,&nbsp;or in a simple
    spreadsheet. Generate the Risk Distribution chart using custom reporting capabilities of Rational tools or&nbsp;using
    charting capabilities in a basic spreadsheet tool.
</p>
<h3>
    Assumptions and prerequisites
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Risks are captured, and the team collaborates with stakeholders to determine likelihood and impact.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<h3>
    Pitfalls, advice, and countermeasures
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        If risk is not managed consistently throughout the lifecycle, the team will likely begin to act in a reactive,
        crisis mode as risks emerge. A consistent, repeatable risk mitigation process enables better project predictability
        and higher levels of trust by project stakeholders.
    </li>
    <li>
        The need to identify and monitor risk increases with the complexity of the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        The effort to reduce uncertainty has an associated cost. The team must balance the cost of this effort against the
        potential impact of not addressing the risk. Not all candidate risks are actively managed. Mitigation effort and
        degree of monitoring depend on the likelihood of impact and the risk tolerance for the project.

    Getting&nbsp;Started:
</h3>
<p>
    The ultimate goal of integration is to minimize the time between injecting a change into the code base&nbsp;and
    creating a working build that includes that change.&nbsp;The ideal is to perform continuous integration.&nbsp;However,
    as systems become larger and components are developed by separate subteams, it becomes necessary to introduce staged
    integration.
</p>
<p>
    Staged integration requires coordination between components and component teams.&nbsp;If your system is complicated
    enough to require a staged integration approach, then you will typically require a dedicated person or team to be
    responsible for this coordination.&nbsp;In order to allow the system build to compile and&nbsp;evolve to include
    increasing levels of functionality, the integrators need to understand&nbsp;the following: the architecture of&nbsp;the
    system,&nbsp;the dependencies between components, and the sequence of development.
</p>
<h4>
    Developer practices
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Make changes available frequently.</b> For integration to be effective, component teams&nbsp;need to regularly
        qualify subsystem builds and make them available for&nbsp;higher level integration. Keep&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkwithUsertext" href="./../../../core.mgmt.common.extend_supp/guidances/concepts/change_set_430BF233.html" guid="_1QU9MAIoEdyLh7vsrHZ4YA">change set</a>s small, complete, cohesive, and available for integration,&nbsp;so
        that they can be completed and tested in a relatively short time span.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Don't break the build.</b> Coordinate changes so that system builds evolve, rather than break and have to be
        fixed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Fix broken builds immediately.</b> When a problem is identified, fix it as soon as possible, while it is still
        fresh in your mind. If the problem cannot be quickly resolved, back out (do not complete) the changes.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Integration practices
</h4>
<p>
    A build is more than a compile (compilation). A build consists of compilation, testing, inspection, and deployment.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Provide feedback</b> as quickly as possible.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Automate the build process</b> so that it is fast and repeatable and so that issues are identified and conveyed
        to the appropriate person for resolution as quickly as possible.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Automation
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Commit your test scripts</strong> to the CM repository so they are controlled and available to the rest of
        the team. Automated testing is highly recommended, both for developer tests and integration tests. Tests need to be
        repeatable and fast.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Commit your build scripts</strong> to the CM repository so they are controlled and available to the rest of
        the team. Automated builds are highly recommended, both for private builds and integration builds. Builds need to
        be repeatable and fast.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>A build process that doesn't identify problems.</b> A build is more that a simple compilation (or its dynamic
        language variations). Adopt sound testing and inspection practices, both at developer testing and integration
        testing levels, so to ensure the right amount of coverage.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Integration builds that take too long to complete.</b> The build process must balance coverage with speed. You
        don't have to run every system level acceptance test to meet the intent of continuous integration. Use staged
        builds&nbsp;to provide a useful means to organize testing to get the balance coverage and speed.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Change sets that are too large.</b> Developers must develop the discipline and skills to organize their work
        into small, cohesive change sets. This will simplify testing, debugging, and reporting. It will also ensure that
        changes are made available frequently enough to meet the intention of continuous integration.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Failure to commit defects to the CM repository.</b> Ensure adequate testing by developers before making change
        sets available.
    </li>
</ul></td>

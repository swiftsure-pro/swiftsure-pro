<p>
    The include-relationship connects a base use case to an inclusion use case. The inclusion use case is always abstract.
    It describes a behavior segment that is inserted into a use-case instance that is executing the base use case. The base
    use case has control of the relationship to the inclusion and can depend on the result of performing the inclusion, but
    neither the base nor the inclusion&nbsp;can access each other's attributes. The inclusion is in this sense
    encapsulated, and represents behavior that can be reused in different base use cases.
</p>
<p>
    You can use the include-relationship to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Factor out behavior from the base use case that is not necessary for the understanding of the primary purpose of
        the use case, only the result of it is important.
    </li>
    <li>
        Factor out behavior that is in common for two or more use cases.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="exampleheading">
    Example:
</p>
<p class="example">
    In an ATM system, the use cases Withdraw Cash, Deposit Cash, and Transfer Funds all need to include how the customer is
    identified to the system. This behavior can be extracted to a new inclusion use case called Identify Customer, which
    the three base use cases include. The base use cases are independent of the method used for identification, and it is
    therefore encapsulated in the inclusion use case. From the perspective of the base use cases, it does not matter
    whether the method for identification is to read a magnetic bank card, or perform a retinal scan. They only depend on
    the result of Identify Customer, which is the identity of the customer. And vice versa, from the perspective of the
    Identify Customer use case, it does not matter how the base use cases use the customer identity or what has happened in
    them before the inclusion is executed - the method for identification is still exactly the same.
</p>

</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    In the ATM system, the use cases Withdraw Cash, Deposit Cash, and Transfer Funds all include the use case Identify
    Customer.
</p>
<p>
    A base use case&nbsp;can have multiple inclusions. One inclusion use case&nbsp;can be included in several base use
    cases. This does not indicate any relationship between the base use cases. You&nbsp;can even have multiple
    include-relationships between the same inclusion use case and base use case, provided the inclusion is inserted at
    different locations of the base use case. The include-relationship defines what the location is. All additions&nbsp;can
    be nested, which means that an inclusion use case&nbsp;can serve as the base use case for another inclusion.
</p>
<p>
    Because&nbsp;the inclusion use case is abstract, it does not need to have an actor associated with it. A
    communication-association to an actor is only needed if the behavior in the inclusion explicitly involves interaction
    with an actor.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Executing the Inclusion" name="Executing the Inclusion">Executing the Inclusion</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The behavior of the inclusion is inserted in one location in the base use case. When a use-case instance following the
    description of a base use case reaches a location in the base use case from which include-relationship is defined, it
    will follow the description of the inclusion use case instead. Once the inclusion is performed, the use-case instance
    will resume where it left off in the base use case.

</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    A use-case instance following the description of a base use case including its inclusion.
</p>
<p>
    The include-relationship is not conditional: if the use-case instance reaches the location in the base use case for
    which it is defined, it is always executed. If you want to express a condition, you need to do that as part of the base
    use case. If the use-case instance never reaches the location for which the include-relationship is defined, it will
    not be executed.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img height="224" alt="Diagram described in accompanying text." src="./../../../practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/./resources/include3.gif" width="307" />
</p>
<p class="picturetext">
    Use-case instance #1 reaches the location in the base use case for which the include-relationship is defined, and the
    inclusion is performed. Use-case instance #2 does not reach that location, and the inclusion is therefore not performed
    as part of that instance.
</p>
<p>
    The inclusion use case is one continuous segment of behavior, all of which is included at one location in the base use
    case. If you have separate segments of behavior that need to be inserted at different locations, you&nbsp;must consider
    the extend-relationship (see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.tech.use_case_driven_dev.extend-ibm/guidances/guidelines/defining_extend_relationships_9E99C694.html" guid="_hjbKkEk-Edyi3_jfs__bIQ">Guideline: Defining Extend Relationships</a>).
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Describing the Include-Relationship" name="Describing the Include-Relationship">Describing the
    Include-Relationship</a>
</h3>
<p>
    For the include-relationship, you&nbsp;must define the location within in the behavior sequence of the base use case
    where the inclusion is to be inserted. The location can be defined by referring to a particular step or subflow within
    the flow of events of the base use case.
</p>
<p class="exampleheading">
    Example:
</p>
<p class="example">
    In the ATM system, the use case Withdraw Cash includes the use case Identify Customer. The include-relationship from
    Withdraw Cash to Identify Customer can be described as follows:
</p>
<p class="example">
    Identify Customer is inserted between sections 1.1 Start of Use Case and 1.2 Ask for Amount in the flow of events of
    Withdraw Cash.
</p>
<p>
    For the sake of clarity, you&nbsp;must also mention the inclusion in the text describing the flow of events of the base
    use case.
</p>

    <a id="Example of Use" name="Example of Use">Example of Use</a>
</h3>
<p>
    If there is a behavior segment in a use case where you can see that the use case is not dependent on how things are
    done, but it is dependent on the result of the function, you can simplify the use case by extracting this behavior to
    an inclusion use case. The inclusion use case can be included in several base use cases, which means it lets you reuse
    behavior among use cases in the model. Consider the following step-by-step outlines to use cases for a simple phone
    system:
</p>
<h4>
    Place Call
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Caller lifts the receiver.
    </li>
    <li>
        System presents a dial-tone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Caller dials a digit.
    </li>
    <li>
        System turns off dial-tone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Caller enters remainder of number.
    </li>
    <li>
        System analyzes the digits, and determines the network address of the Receiving Party.
    </li>
    <li>
        System determines whether a virtual circuit can be established between the Caller and the Receiving Party.
    </li>
    <li>
        System allocates all resources for virtual circuit and establishes connection.
    </li>
    <li>
        System rings Receiving Party's phone.
    </li>
    <li>
        And so on.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    <b>Start System</b>
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Operator activates the system.
    </li>
    <li>
        System performs diagnostic tests on all components.
    </li>
    <li>
        System tests connections all adjacent systems. For each adjacent system, the System determines whether a virtual
        circuit can be established between itself and the adjacent system. The System allocates all resources for the
        virtual circuit and establishes connection.
    </li>
    <li>
        System responds that it is ready for operation.
    </li>
    <li>
        And so on.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The text listed in blue is very similar; in both cases we are performing the same behavior, although for very different
    reasons. This similarity can be exploited, and we can extract the common behavior into a new use case, Manage Virtual
    Circuits.
</p>
<p>
    Once common behavior has been extracted, the use cases become:
</p>
<h4>
    <b>Place Call</b>
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Caller lifts receiver.
    </li>
    <li>
        System presents dial-tone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Caller dials a digit.
    </li>
    <li>
        System turns off dial-tone.
    </li>
    <li>
        Caller enters remainder of number.
    </li>
    <li>
        System analyzes digits, determines network address of the Receiving Party.
    </li>
    <li>
        Include the Manage Virtual Circuit use case to establish connectivity within the network.
    </li>
    <li>
        System rings the Receiving Party's phone.
    </li>
    <li>
        And so on.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    <b>Start System</b>
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Operator activates system.
    </li>
    <li>
        System performs diagnostic tests on all components.
    </li>
    <li>
        System tests connections all adjacent systems. For each adjacent system (loop), include Manage Virtual Circuit to
        establish connectivity with the network.
    </li>
    <li>
        System responds that it is ready for operation.
    </li>
    <li>
        And so on.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    In a use-case diagram, the include-relationship that is created will be illustrated as follows:

<p class="picturetext">
    The use cases Place Call and Start System both include the behavior of the abstract use case Manage Virtual Circuit.

                    <strong>Process<br />
                    </strong> A general structure for particular types of development projects. Processes take content
                    elements and relate them into semi-ordered sequences that are customized to specific types of projects.
                    Thus, a Process is a set of partially ordered work descriptions intended to reach a higher development
                    goal, such as the release of a specific software. These work descriptions are organized into a
                    hierarchical breakdown-structure. A Process focuses on the lifecycle and the sequencing of work in
                    breakdown structures.

                    products. A set of processes make up a process category. For example the ITUP processes for Solution

                    such as release notes or installation instructions. A release can be internal or external. An internal
                    release is used only by the development organization, as part of a milestone, or for a demonstration to
                    users or customers. An external release (or delivery) is delivered to users. A release is not
                    necessarily a complete product, but can just be one step along the way, with its usefulness measured
                    only from an engineering perspective. Releases act as a forcing function that drives the development
                    team to get closure at regular intervals, avoiding the "90% done, 90% remaining" syndrome.

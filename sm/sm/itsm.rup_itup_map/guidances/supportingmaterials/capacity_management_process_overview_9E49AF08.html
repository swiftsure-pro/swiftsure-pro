    Goals
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        To ensure that cost justifiable IT capacity always exists and that it is matched to the current and future
        identified needs of the business
    </li>
    <li>
        To accommodate scalability requirements
    </li>
    <li>
        To avoid incidents caused by lack of capacity
    </li>
    <li>
        To reduce the cost of capacity acquisition by planning and optimizing capacity usage&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Scope&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    The process covers the range from understanding service requirements, component capacities, and the design and
    deployment of capacity to meet expectations through the collection and analysis of data relevant to infrastructure
    utilization and performance in order to determine whether there are potential problems and issues that need to be
    addressed.
</p>
<p>
    ITIL defines three focus areas which are addressed by Capacity Management. Each uses the primary activities of the
    process decomposition in differing ways, to differing end results.

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            This focus area is responsible for ensuring that the future business requirements for IT services are
            considered, planned, and implemented in a timely fashion. This can be achieved by using the existing data on
            the current resource utilization by the various services to trend, forecast or model the future requirements.
            These future requirements will come from business plans outlining new services, improvements and growth in
            existing services and development plans.

</blockquote>
<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
    <ul>
        <li>
            This focus area is the management of the performance of the IT services used by the customers. It is
            responsible for ensuring that the performance of all services, as detailed in the targets in the SLAs and SLRs
            is monitored and measured, and that the collected data is recorded, analyzed, and reported. As necessary,
            action will be taken to ensure that the performance of the services meets the business requirements. This is
            performed by staff with knowledge of all the areas of technology used in the delivery of end-to-end service,
            and will often involve seeking advice from the specialists involved in Resource Capacity Management.

    <ul>

            This focus area is the management of the individual components of the IT infrastructure. It is responsible for
            ensuring that all components in the IT infrastructure that have finite resources are monitored and measured,
            and that the collected data is recorded, analyzed, and reported. As necessary, action will be taken to manage
            the available resources to ensure that the IT services that it supports meet the business requirements. In
            carrying out this work, the Capacity Management process will be assisted by individuals with specific knowledge
            in the particular areas of technology.&nbsp;

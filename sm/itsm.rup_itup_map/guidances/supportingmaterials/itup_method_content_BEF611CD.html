    The <a href="http://www-306.ibm.com/software/tivoli/features/it-serv-mgmt/itup/overview.html" target="_blank">IBM&reg;
    Tivoli&reg; Unified Process (ITUP)</a> provides detailed documentation of&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/supportingmaterials/it_service_mgt_E2F39C96.html" guid="_aVn-gNcsEduuLL7MyRZJCQ">IT Service Management</a> processes based on industry best practices. ITUP gives you the
    ability to significantly improve your organization's efficiency and effectiveness. ITUP enables you to easily
    understand processes, the relationships between processes, and the roles and tools involved in an efficient process
    implementation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    ITUP contains the following resources:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <h5>
        Process Library
    </h5><img height="291" alt="ITUP Diamond" src="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/supportingmaterials/./resources/itup_diamond.gif" width="291" align="right" /> 
    <p>
        The processes described within ITUP are closely aligned with the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/supportingmaterials/itil_overview_3741573B.html" guid="_7OTIcMj5Edu1pZBJxrGKRA">Information Technology Infrastructure Library速 (ITIL速)</a>&nbsp;which is based on IT
        industry best practices. ITIL provides high-level guidance for what you should implement, but it does not guide you
        in how to do the actual implementation. ITUP contains detailed process diagrams and descriptions to help you
        understand processes and their relationships, making the ITIL best practice recommendations more implementable. You
        can also map ITUP to other leading process models, such as COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related
        Technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        ITUP is based on the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/whitepapers/prm_it_CCAD6FAE.html" guid="_Qce5QMkBEdu1pZBJxrGKRA">IBM Process Reference Model for IT速 (PRM-IT速)</a>, which was jointly developed by
        IBM Global Services and Tivoli. PRM-IT offers detailed process guidance for all activities that are the
        responsibility of an organization's Chief Information Officer (CIO), including but not limited to IT Service
        Management.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Tool Mentors
    </h5>
    <p>
        Tool mentors describe best practices for using IBM tools in the context specific processes. A tool mentor helps you
        identify which IBM products and solutions to use to execute specific activities and describes in detail how to use
        these tools appropriately. This guidance enables you to reduce time, effort, and errors, and to get the maximum
        value out of your investment.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Roles
    </h5>
    <p>
        IT staff are typically responsible for one or more roles in their job responsibility. These roles are associated
        with the execution of specific tasks. ITUP Composer describes these roles and responsibilities in detail, and
        provides tool mentor guidance to enable staff to do their jobs more efficiently and effectively.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Work Products
    </h5>
    <p>
        Work products, often referred to as artifacts, are the inputs or outputs of processes. ITUP describes the work
        products for each process, as well as additional information like definitions of key terms.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Scenarios
    </h5>
    <p>
        Scenarios describe common problems and best-practice solutions. With these scenarios, you are able to see how to
        address real-world problems by improving and integrating processes, using the appropriate tool properly, and
        setting up the necessary roles and responsibilities.
    </p>

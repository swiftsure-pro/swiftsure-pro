    Both RUP and ITUP have well-defined approaches to managing changes.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        In RUP, changes involve existing applications or systems and the activity is called <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{BFBA9E6A-CB4B-45A7-9A25-FF7CA1A1153D}">Manage Change Requests</a> within the Change and Configuration
        Management Discipline.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        In ITUP, changes involve the entire IT infrastructure and the process is called the <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/supportingmaterials/change_management_process_overview_B091DC7B.html" guid="_cY7nwNlVEduIEKpjb7YVnw">Change Management</a> Process.&nbsp; This is essentially the same as ITIL Change
        Management.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Commonality
</h3>
<p>
    The high-level lifecycle of managing changes is the same within both RUP and ITUP.&nbsp; The lifecycle includes:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Submission of a proposed change
    </li>
    <li>
        Assessment of the proposed change
    </li>
    <li>
        Approval or rejection of the proposed change
    </li>
    <li>
        Implementation of the approved change
    </li>
    <li>
        Verification that the change was implemented
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    At a high level, both RUP and ITUP process changes in the same way.&nbsp; However, the context in which changes are
    made and the low-level approach to processing changes is different in ITUP and RUP.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Variability
</h3>
<p>
    <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{BFBA9E6A-CB4B-45A7-9A25-FF7CA1A1153D}">Manage Change Requests</a> in RUP involves the capture and management of
    changes requested to new or existing systems.&nbsp; Change requests may be initiated by anyone to propose a change to
    either an existing system or a new system.&nbsp; Change requests are managed by the development project and are tracked
    as they are assessed, approved, implemented.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    ITUPâ€™s Change Management process handles all requested changes to the IT infrastructure.&nbsp; This may include new or
    existing software, but may also include changes to the operation of applications and services, operational procedures,
    service requests, and anything else that someone might want to see changed within the IT infrastructure.&nbsp; A
    requested change comes in the form of a <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/termdefinitions/request_for_change_B11DE8A2.html" guid="_06R50NlZEduIEKpjb7YVnw">Request for Change (RFC)</a>. All RFCs are managed by the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/termdefinitions/change_advisory_board_2056DB97.html" guid="_ay7-gAexEdyJWNqCAR2tfw">Change Advisory Board (CAB)</a>.&nbsp; Typically, RFCs that request changes for existing
    systems are forwarded to the appropriate development organization, although such changes that may affect other systems
    may first be considered by the Change Advisory Board.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Thus, changes have a different context in RUP and ITUP.&nbsp; RUP focuses specifically on software development
    including management of workspaces, parallel development, integration, and builds. Whereas ITUP focuses on all IT
    changes including&nbsp;changes to the operation of applications and services, operational procedures, service requests,
    and anything else that someone might want to see changed within the IT infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of situations in which RUP Change Request Management would be integrated&nbsp; with ITUP Change Management
    include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Making a change to an existing application
    </li>
    <li>
        Creating a new application
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are described in the following sections.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Making a change to an existing application
</h4>
<p>
    An IT user requests a change to an existing IT application.&nbsp; This flow of events is shown in Figure 1.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/termdefinitions/request_for_change_B11DE8A2.html" guid="_06R50NlZEduIEKpjb7YVnw">Request for Change (RFC)</a> in ITUP is sent to the ITUP <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/supportingmaterials/change_management_process_overview_B091DC7B.html" guid="_cY7nwNlVEduIEKpjb7YVnw">Change Management</a> process.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        RUP <img alt="" src="./../../../images/no_rup.gif">&#160;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../pages_not_installed/pages_not_installed.html" guid="{C85C9CC0-AD92-46C9-85BA-4C0672D6571E}">Configuration & Change Management</a> is involved at this point,
        since the application stakeholders want to provide their own assessment of the requested change. RUP Change
        Management creates a Change Request based on the Request for Change.&nbsp; (It should be noted that another change
        must be made to the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/termdefinitions/service_catalog_8541EC28.html" guid="_HgSrEPTXEduUeJnLjgZmMw">Service Catalog</a>, part of <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/supportingmaterials/service_level_management_process_overview_14E4985A.html" guid="_bDjQcMw0EdusP-U9ZTiwNw">Service Level Management</a>, because of the new functionality.)
    </li>
    <li>
        The approval of the RUP Change Request Management process (along with those of other assessment groups) are
        provided to the Change Advisory Board of ITUP Change Management.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The Change Advisory Board approves the change as worthy of implementation.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The RFC is sent to the Portfolio Management process to determine how the development project would fit within the
        portfolio of existing and anticipated projects and when resources would be available for the project.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Portfolio Management eventually approves the initiation of the update project and creates&nbsp; a project charter,
        which is sent to the development team for that application.&nbsp; This project charter is used to generate one or
        more Change Requests for that application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The development team implements the change, verifies the change in the build, and tells the ITUP Change Manager
        that the updated application is ready for deployment.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Change Manager makes sure the Service Catalog has also been updated, then the application is deployed out via
        <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../itsm.rup_itup_map/guidances/supportingmaterials/release_management_process_overview_97C58082.html" guid="_IY28ANiiEdurhpzzNRNA2w">Release Management</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        The results of deployment are reviewed by the Change Manager and the RFC is finally closed.&nbsp;
    </li>

    Figure 1 - &nbsp;Application Update Sequence of Events
</p>
<h4>
    Creating a New Application
</h4>
<p>
    The Service Level Manager submits an RFC requesting a new application, which represents a new IT service.&nbsp; This
    flow of events is shown in Figure 2.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A Request For Change (RFC) in ITUP is sent to the ITUP Change Management process.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The Change Advisory Board asks various teams to assess the impact of the proposed application.&nbsp; This involves
        a variety of teams who consider availability, capacity, security, and other aspects.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        These assessments are reviewed as part of the approval of the application.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The Change Advisory Board approves the change as worthy of implementation.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        The RFC is sent to the Portfolio Management process to determine how the development project would fit within the
        portfolio of existing and anticipated projects and when resources would be available for the project.&nbsp;

        that the updated application is ready for deployment.
    </li>
    <li>
        The Change Manager makes sure the Service Catalog has also been updated, then the application is deployed out via
        Release Management.
    </li>
    <li>
        The results of deployment are reviewed by the Change Manager and the RFC is finally closed.&nbsp;

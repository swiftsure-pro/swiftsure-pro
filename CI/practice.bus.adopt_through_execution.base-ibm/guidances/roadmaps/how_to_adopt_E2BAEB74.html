    Introduction
</h3>
<p>
    Executing the process -- not defining it -- is the real challenge for organizations focused on capability improvement.
    Project teams must know where to start, how to proceed, and how to apply the process and tools effectively in real
    projects.&nbsp;The only process that really matters is the one people actually use.&nbsp;Real change only occurs when
    peoples' daily habits change, and that requires doing and practicing over time. Change efforts based on "telling and
    teaching" or coercion almost never succeed. People change when they are motivated to apply the necessary effort.<br />
</p>
<h3>
    Getting Started
</h3>
<h4>
    Establish a mentoring program
</h4>
<p>
    Mentoring is the key to successful&nbsp;adoption of process and tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;Create a&nbsp;Center
    of&nbsp;Capability organization with well defined mentoring roles&nbsp;to provide deployment support to projects.
    Experience shows that using mentors is crucial if you want the implementation of a new process to succeed. If you do
    not have mentors, there is&nbsp;a clear risk that the people on the project will fall back into their old habits.
</p>
<p>
    The mentor acts as a driver of change. It is important that the process mentor understands the significance of being a
    change driver and makes sure that the work progresses. It is also important that the mentor becomes dispensable and
    that there is an end to&nbsp;the mentoring effort.&nbsp;Therefore, the mentor needs to transfer both knowledge and
    responsibilities to members of the project.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Mentors must cultivate trust by getting to know team members, the problem domain, and project objectives. Unless they
    are deeply engaged, it is difficult for mentors to add value. Mentors help people focus on doing without having to
    figuring out what to do. They build confidence in the outcome of a change because they have been successful on other
    projects. This confidence builds resilience within the team so that it can recover from the inevitable setbacks that
    will occur during the change effort. Of course, the mentor's ultimate goal is to build enough expertise and confidence
    within the project team for them to support the new way of working without external help.<br />
</p>
<h4>
    Distribute process ownership and demonstrate value
</h4>
<p>
    Distribute ownership for the process among&nbsp;project teams adopting the improvements.&nbsp;With this&nbsp;approach
    teams are&nbsp;more likely to adopt and learn the new process faster. The result is better when the "real experts,"
    those people on the project,&nbsp;evolve&nbsp;it themselves. Evolve&nbsp;process descriptions, tool configurations and
    usage models incrementally based on&nbsp;lessons learned and feedback from projects.<br />
    <br />
    Demonstrate the value of process and tool improvements&nbsp;in real projects. Show how effective use of the new
    capabilities helps&nbsp;achieve technical and business results quickly.
</p>
<h4>
    Measure the value and success of deployments using metrics
</h4>
<p>
    Determine the expected value of mentoring efforts and identify&nbsp;metrics to monitor progress and performance against
    objectives.
</p>
<h3>
    Common pitfalls
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        When there is no concrete mandate to adopt (by project, by date) adoption is at risk. Ensure empowered program
        management is in place with clear objectives and measures.
    </li>
    <li>
        Confirm sufficient numbers of qualified and skilled mentors to meet adoption objectives. If needed, obtain outside
        resources or scale back deployment plans.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of buy-in from development groups is a common pitfall for process and tool improvement efforts. The Center of
        Capability must evangelize the improvements and address concerns of managers to generate demand.
    </li>
    <li>
        When mentoring and technology costs are charged to projects, resistance is elevated. Eliminate this barrier to
        adoption by funding mentoring and adoption costs at the enterprise level for cost neutrality.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ad hoc mentoring with no structure in place rarely works. Mentoring must be part of these practitioners' formal job
        responsibilities so that they can give it the proper amount of attention. It should not be a spare time task that
        they feel obliged to push off in favor of more critical activities. The organization should recognize and reward
        mentoring as a key leadership skill.
    </li>
    <li>
        Management often expects&nbsp;a high linear rate of adoption, but this is not realistic. Deployment progresses
        slower initially as configurations and deployment models must be adjusted to facilitate early wins. With the
        achievement of credible wins, peer endorsements will influence greater acceptance. Nevertheless, at some point
        demand exceeds skilled deployment capacity, thus limiting the adoption rate. Without separation of deployment,
        support, and administrative functions, the adoption rate will eventually plateau. However, developing standards,
        automated administration, and more skilled resources along the way can restore/accelerate the adoption rate.

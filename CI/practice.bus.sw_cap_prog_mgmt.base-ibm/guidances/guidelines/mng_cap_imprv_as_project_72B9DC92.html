    Phased Approach
</h3>
<p>
    Implementing software development process and tools&nbsp;in an organization is a complex task and needs to be done in a
    controlled manner. We recommend treating it as a project that is external to or is a sub-project of your
    software&nbsp;capability improvement&nbsp;program. Set up milestones, allocate resources, and manage it as you would
    any other project.
</p>
<p>
    The process-implementation project is divided into a number of phases where all four steps are performed in each phase
    until the project is ready and the process and tools are deployed and successfully used by the entire organization as
    shown in the following figure.

<p>
    A project to implement process and tools in an organization has many similarities to a software development project. It
    has even been suggested that the phases above are named Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition as they
    are for a software development project using the Rational Unified Process. However, we recommend that you do not use
    the same names on the phases to avoid any confusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Planning Considerations
</h3>
<p class="picturetext">
    Some typical factors and how they can affect the plans are provided below.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="picturetext">
            Problems in the current development process. Focus on those areas of the development process where the
            organization has problems today. Focus on areas where you can expect some easy results and where people can see
            the benefits early. Make sure the first iterations focus on an area where you know you will address and solve
            one of the major problems in today's organization.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="picturetext">
            The need for change in the current organization. If there are lots of problems in the organization-with the
            tools or the way people work-the frustration level in the organization will be high. In this case, you can be
            more aggressive and employ the new process and tools, or parts of them, in real projects.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="picturetext">
            The capacity for change in the current organization. If they are either unaccustomed to change or currently
            overwhelmed by it, the goals of the first few iterations should be modest. In this case, the primary objective
            should be to build credibility and confidence in the process, with more intrusive changes reserved for later
            iterations when they can be more easily accommodated. See <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.sw_cap_prog_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/concepts/managing_org_change_46D3611F.html" guid="_cBlnQG23Ed-vK5B6ZgVtPg">Concept: Managing Organizational Change</a>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="picturetext">
            The size of the organization. If the organization using the process and tools is large, be sure that the
            development case and the tools are stable enough to be used by many developers. In this case, be more careful
            by implementing the process and supporting tools during several iterations in one or more software development
            projects.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="picturetext">
            The risks involved. If they are small, be more aggressive and start using the process and tools in new projects
            earlier. If the risks are large, be more careful and use pilot projects to verify the process and the tools.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="picturetext">
            The attitude among people in the organization. Communicate the problems with today's organization and how it's
            working. If current personnel understand today's problems, it will be easier to accept and understand the need
            for change. Involve those people outside of the immediately affected part of the organization.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="picturetext">
    <br />
    Do not try to do everything all at once. Instead, divide the implementation into a number of increments and, in each
    one, implement a portion of the new process together with the supporting tools. Typically, focus on one of the areas
    where you believe the change will have the most impact. For example, if the software development organization is weak
    in testing, you may start by introducing&nbsp;Test practices&nbsp;with tools that automate testing. However, if the
    organization is weak in capturing or managing requirements, start by introducing Requirements practices together with
    its supporting tools.<br />
    <br />
    Implement the process and tools in iterations of software development projects whether in pilot projects or real
    projects. The purpose is to verify the process and the tools in as real an environment as possible. Consider the
    following points when you select software development projects and iterations:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div class="picturetext">
            If the goal is to implement the process and tools in one single software development project, decide to
            implement the process and tools in that one project, then monitor and improve the process as the project
            continues.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="picturetext">
            If the goal is to implement the process and tools in a large organization over many projects, consider
            implementing and verifying the process and tools in iterations over several phases. In that case, choose a
            relatively small project where you can apply the process and tools during the whole lifecycle of a software
            project.
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div class="picturetext">
            If the improvements&nbsp;represent a significant departure from your current software engineering process, if
            you need to get a better handle on the risks and advantages of introducing the new process or if you are in a
            new organization with little or no process in place, try them out&nbsp;on a mini-project or a pilot project
            before applying it to your major, mission-critical development project.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>

    information about implementation approaches.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    The use of a new process, new tools, and possibly new technology in a software project makes the project's schedule
    more volatile. Be sure to allocate time and resources to implement the process, train people, and so on during the
    iteration in the software-development project where you start using the process and tools.

    <br />
    Top Reasons for Failure
</h3>
<p>
    It is important to understand these top reasons for failure:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Failure to incrementally implement process and tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of management support.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of bringing stakeholders on board. All stakeholders affected by the new process and tools must be onboard,
        including customers, other department, and sub-contractors.
    </li>
    <li>
        Lack of willingness or ability to deal with organizational change.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These reasons focus on non-technical issues, which is exactly what our experience shows.

    Workshops are often used to support the&nbsp;assessment of an organization's software development processes and
    tools.&nbsp;During the workshop:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        process engineers meet the stakeholders of the project
    </li>
    <li>
        a comprehensive list of problems is gathered&nbsp;from project stakeholders
    </li>
    <li>
        stakeholders attending the workshop prioritize the needed improvements
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="Preparation" name="Preparation">Prepare for the Workshop</a>
</h3>
<p>
    Conducting an assessment workshop means gathering all stakeholders for an intensive, focused session. Typically, an
    assessment workshop takes half a day or a full day to conduct.
</p>
<p>
    Ask representatives from the development organization to prepare a presentation on how the development organization
    currently works. The presentation should take no more than an hour and covers areas such as organizational structure,
    number of people, people's competence and experience, business goals and objectives, and brief descriptions of typical
    projects. The presentation should also discuss the underlying reasons behind the organization's decision to change
    process and tools, such as problems, changing business context, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Note: An assessment workshop is just one of several ways to gather information about an organization. It needs to be
    complemented by other methods for collecting information.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Who" name="Who">Who Should Attend</a>
</h3>
<p>
    A process engineer should act as a facilitator. Normally, it is better&nbsp;if the facilitator is not part of the
    development organization. It is&nbsp;easier, perhaps even essential, for an external person to give a fresh perspective
    and to ask the necessary provocative questions that elicit underlying problems. Because changing the software
    development process is often politically charged, it is&nbsp;essential that the facilitator is respected by all
    parties, and is viewed as fair and impartial.
</p>
<p>
    The number of participants should be between 3 and 8, including the facilitator. The assessment workshop includes
    representatives from several different areas of the organization to give as accurate a picture of the current state as
    possible. Invite a good mix of people to cover as many areas as possible, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Project managers
    </li>
    <li>
        Software architects
    </li>
    <li>
        Experienced analysts
    </li>
    <li>
        Experienced developers
    </li>
    <li>
        Experienced testers
    </li>
    <li>
        Development department manager
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Changes in the software engineering process will affect many people in the software development organization,
    therefore, many people will want to be involved. There are some advantages to this because participation often breeds
    support. The tendency to include more people in the workshop, however, should be strongly resisted. Increasing the
    number of people makes the workshop harder, or impossible, to manage. As an alternative, consider having each team
    elect a representative to the workshop or conduct several workshops, one for each team. The purpose of the workshop is
    to gather information, not to make decisions. As long as people feel their concerns as adequately represented, they
    tend to be supportive of the process.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Before" name="Before">Before the Workshop</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The facilitator needs to sell the workshop to those who should attend, thereby establishing the group who will
    participate in the workshop. Give the attendees preparatory material to review before they arrive, especially the
    process engineer who should be as well prepared as possible. The preparatory material should include an agenda for the
    workshop that communicates the workshop's scope and goals which need to be reviewed by each participant. Doing this
    will identify any possible issues or hidden agendas before the workshop begins.
</p>
<p>
    The facilitator or process engineer needs access to materials such as descriptions of the development organization and
    descriptions of the existing process.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Conduct" name="Conduct">Conduct the Workshop</a>
</h3>
<p>
    The facilitator conducts the workshop, which includes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Giving everyone an opportunity to speak. This is essential if the workshop is to be perceived as fair and
        impartial.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keeping the session on track. There is a great tendency for these kind of workshops to turn into gripe sessions.
        Identify problems, but do not dwell on them. Once a problem has been identified, move on.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gathering input.
    </li>
    <li>
        Gathering the findings.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarizing the session and working out conclusions.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    A typical agenda for an assessment workshop would include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Give a presentation of the development organization by one of its senior representatives.
    </li>
    <li>
        Give a presentation of the assessment approach by a process engineer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify problem areas. Conduct a brainstorming session to identify all problems in the development organization.
        Make sure that every part of the development organization is covered.
    </li>
    <li>
        Rank the problem areas. Come up with a ranking order between the problem areas. Consider using Pareto Diagrams.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify the root causes of the problems. Fishbone Diagrams can be helpful for doing this. Be careful not to spend
        too much time identifying root causes because the primary focus of the assessment workshop is to uncover visible
        problems. Continual information collection and later analysis by the process engineer will aim at uncovering the
        root causes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Summarize the problems. The facilitator summarizes the meeting and its outcome. Give the participants a chance to
        express whether they agree, or if they there is anything to add or withdraw.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify two or three projects where the problems can be further studied.
    </li>
    <li>
        Identify persons to interview for the assessment.
    </li>
    <li>
        Outline a schedule for the remaining assessment activities. If possible, set dates for interviews and future
        workshops.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <a id="Facilitating" name="Facilitating">Facilitate Communication</a>
</h3>
<p>
    An assessment workshop is about communication between people. To make it easier to understand each other, you need a
    common understanding of the software-development process. Structure the workshop around disciplines or process areas
    that are part of the organization's process framework.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Consolidate" name="Consolidate">Consolidate Results</a>
</h3>
<p>
    After the assessment workshop, the facilitator, along with fellow process engineers, needs to spend more time
    synthesizing the findings and condensing the information into a presentable format. The conclusions should be the
    product of the workshop participants, rather than those of the facilitator.
</p>
<p>
    The organization itself must express ownership of the conclusions if any progress is to be made. Collectively, they
    need to agree on the problems that need to be solved, and express them in a non-judgmental way. The purpose of the
    assessment is to identify areas that require improvement, not to criticize or accuse individuals.

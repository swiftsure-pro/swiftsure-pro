    Decide when you what to launch the process and tool improvements&nbsp;to a wider audience of software development
    projects. You may want to run one or two pilot projects before you launch to the entire organization. For more
    information about alternative implementation approaches, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../practice.bus.sw_cap_prog_mgmt.base-ibm/guidances/guidelines/select_cap_improv_rolllout_strat_57F0114A.html" guid="_26QKMG5kEd-oCKFuc0HsDQ">Guideline: Selecting a Capability Improvement Roll-Out Strategy</a>.<br />
    <br />
    Decide how to facilitate the launch of process and tools. There are a number of things you can do to facilitate
    software development projects in implementing the process and tools, such as:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Developing ready-to-use templates and examples that all projects can use.
    </li>
    <li>
        Developing training programs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Developing process implementation guidelines that provide guidance to those people who will be responsible for
        implementing both the process and tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        Preparing mentors who will support the projects.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Decide whether you are&nbsp;going to develop an organization-wide development environment that each software
    development project can use with the necessary adaptations.<br />
    <br />
    In most situations, we recommend you wait until several software development projects have used the process and tools
    before you take this step. At that point, it will be easier to identify those parts of the process and tools that are
    reusable and those that will benefit from being owned, and maintained, by a separate organization.<br />
    <br />
    If you decide to develop an organization-wide environment, you must initiate a project to develop the organization's
    development environment.<br />
    <br />
    If you decide to initiate a project that develops the organization-wide development environment, it must be made clear
    that this project team will work very closely with the software development project teams. It must also be understood
    that the team who develops the organization-wide development environment is a service organization measured by the
    success of the software development projects it supports.<br />

<table class="stepTable" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><p>
    Experience shows that having a mentor help with implementing a process is a key success factor. Therefore, we recommend
    that each software development project has a process mentor to help them start using the process. It is&nbsp;impossible
    to give exact figures, but, as a general suggestion, we recommend you plan for at least a 50% full-time equivalence
    during the first few of iterations in the project until the project comes up to speed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The projects also need help setting up the tools, so plan to allocate resources for tool mentoring and tools support.
</p>
<p>
    Mentoring works best when you have a mentor who reviews results, leads workshops (when needed), and answers questions.
    Done well, mentoring can be a very efficient way to transfer knowledge. Ensure that mentors should be experienced
    practitioners not purely process-focused.
</p>
<p>
    The project needs both the resources and the budget for mentoring on the project. The occurrence of some mentoring
    activities need to be planned, such as leading workshops. It's important that the process mentor understands the
    significance of being a change driver and makes sure that the work progresses. It's also important that the mentor
    becomes dispensable and that there is an end to it, therefore, the mentor needs to transfer both knowledge and
    responsibilities to members of the project.

    Education is necessary for successful capability improvement adoption. People need to understand the new processes and
    how to use the new tools. Study the current competency levels among the organization's people documented in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../practice.bus.sw_cap_prog_mgmt.base-ibm/workproducts/devorg_assessment_657D7D1E.html" guid="{3D77E5C1-1FA3-4F5B-B9BE-014EE03CF264}">Artifact: Development Organization Assessment</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Next, look at the parts of the process you plan to implement, and what tools will be introduced in each project.
    Identify those areas where the organization's people need to raise their levels of competency and to what extent this
    must be done.<br />
    <br />
    Decide what training is needed for each project. A change of process and tools affects the entire organization,
    therefore, in addition to mentoring we recommend you train people outside of the projects to give them an understanding
    of what the change means.
</p>
<p>
    There are several ways to educate people to support successful adoption:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Standard training courses to introduce the new process and tools
    </li>
    <li>
        "Boot-camps" consisting of concentrated, hands-on training. Not many organizations can afford boot-camps. However,
        they have proven to be efficient if there are many new elements to learn.
    </li>
    <li>
        "Kick-start" workshops are an efficient way to get the people up-to-speed in a day when introducing a new
        improvement. In this type of workshop, people work using their real project material and following the new parts of
        the process using the new templates, guidelines, and tools. Typically, a process engineer and a tool specialist
        would be responsible for this workshop. Do not spend a lot of time developing training material for a kick-start
        workshop. The main purpose is to give hands-on experience with templates, guidelines, and tools. The kick-start
        workshop is also a way to verify the process assets and tool configurations.

<td><p>
    One common mistake in process and tool adoption is failing to communicate expectations clearly to the effected
    stakeholders. Depending on your organizational culture, use whatever medium is appropriate to communicate the goals and
    expectations to the stakeholders. This might be through briefing sessions, workshops, training sessions, presentations,
    team meetings, teleconferences and so forth.
</p>
<p>
    It is important to communicate and manage&nbsp;organizational changes introduced as part of the improvement program.

<td class="sectionTableSingleCell"><p>
    The greatest threat to any change in an organization is peoples' attitudes towards the change. The following actions
    may help prevent negative attitudes from forming among people in the organization:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Set realistic expectations. Do not oversell the new process or the new tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        Involve key people in the change work. Let them be part of the pilot project and give them responsibility for parts
        of the process.
    </li>
    <li>
        Explain why the change is needed. What problems does the organization have that need to be solved? What changes in
        technology require a new process and new tools?How will you benefit from using these new tools and process?
    </li>
    <li>
        Inform all people in the organization about what is happening. For example, keep all departments informed about
        what is going on. This information doesn't have to be in very great detail; the important thing is that they
        receive some information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Remember stakeholders such as customers or sponsors. For example, if you change from a more waterfall-like
        development approach to an iterative development approach, the stakeholders must understand how an iterative
        development project is managed and how progress is measured. In an iterative development project, for example, they
        cannot expect a completely frozen design at an early milestone. They would also be affected when projects change
        the way they capture requirements.

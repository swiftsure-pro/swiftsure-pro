</p>
<ul>
    <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Tools (e.g. IBM Rational RequisitePro, IBM Rational Team Concert)

        Technology (e.g. distributed systems)

    <li>
        Interpersonal and communication skills
    </li>
    <li>
        Organizational knowledge
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For each of these competency areas, assess the knowledge, expertise, and experience of the people in the organization.
    There are several ways to do this:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Ask one or several managers to rank the competencies of individuals or entire teams.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ask the employees themselves to rank their own competencies in each area.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For each area, estimate the individual's competency. The following is an example of a simple competency scale that can
    be used:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Expert</b>. Can act as mentor to others.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Working knowledg</b>e. Can work independently.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Basic knowledge</b>. May occasionally need help.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Novice</b>. May not be familiar with the subject.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Make a competency profiles of individuals and compile competency profiles for entire teams. It is&nbsp;just as
    important to understand the competency profile of a team as a whole because no individual alone can have all the
    necessary competencies.

<p>
    <strong>Review current descriptions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Read existing process descriptions to understand the depth of the existing development process. For each discipline or
    process area, identify what kinds of description is available for that discipline. For example, find out if there are
    no descriptions at all, and whether there are examples, guidelines, document templates, activity descriptions, artifact
    descriptions, and so on.&nbsp;Confirm that processes are well integrated.&nbsp;Identify integration points between
    processes (e.g. what input and output work products are shared between processes).
</p>
<p>
    Remember that different teams may be using different processes for the same capability.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Compare to process standards</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Consider&nbsp;any process definition&nbsp;requirements as you perform your assessment. Is your industry highly
    regulated, requiring a heavy evidence-based process? Are you trying to achieve a CMMI maturity level that requires
    proof of performing each process requirement?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    It is helpful to compare your process against some standard such as the IBM Rational Unified Process, or to an
    improvement approach such as CMMI for Development. This can help you identify any gaps or areas of insufficient
    coverage. However, do not implement process improvements just to cover gaps. Confirm there is an organizational need
    (the process will help you achieve some operational objective).

    current gaps in your process and tool coverage.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Assess consistency</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Confirm whether processes are applied consistently.&nbsp; Are the process descriptions sufficiently described to be
    repeatable across projects? Do tailoring guidelines exist&nbsp;so that individual project teams know how to apply the
    process in their context?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Conduct interviews</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Make sure to interview your key people&nbsp;and stakeholders as you evaluate process descriptions. Insight from those
    actually using the process and&nbsp;who understand what problems need to be addressed is critical to the assessment.
</p><br />
<p>
    With a good understanding of the existing process, you will:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        understand what type of process description teams are used to.
    </li>
    <li>
        understand what areas they need most for a new process description.

<p>
    Recommendations for the future are&nbsp;developed as part of the assessment. Each recommendation should be prioritized
    and&nbsp;describe how the development organization should go forward to implement process and tool improvements. The
    recommendations could consist of actionable road maps,&nbsp;outlined implementation plans, project plans, tailoring
    suggestions, and so on.
</p>
<p>
    Make recommendations based on the strengths and weaknesses identified in the assessment, defining clear goals of what
    to improve.&nbsp;Ensure that the roadmap for implementation is aligned with the organization's operational objectives.
    Always pay attention to the reasons why the organization should adopt a new process.
</p>
<p>
    Agree on measures for success/improvement from process and tool adoption:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Select from a common set of measures
    </li>
    <li>
        In addition to objective measures, some "subjective measures" can also be identified
    </li>
    <li>
        Focus&nbsp;on key success factors, ideally defined as part of an analysis of Return-On-Investment (ROI).
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Determine your recommendations based on a recent assessment. Do not wait for months after an assessment to prepare
    improvement road maps as the capability snapshot taken at that moment in time may no longer apply.
</p>
<p>
    Present recommendations to stakeholders and key people to achieve consensus and confirm support.&nbsp; An understanding
    of the deployment vision and the steps required to implement this vision is critical. This vision must be shared and
    internalized by all stakeholders.

    A successful assessment requires:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        an identified set of operational objectives against which to measure process performance
    </li>
    <li>
        availability of project and&nbsp;team&nbsp;leads, experienced assessors, and domain subject-matter experts
    </li>
    <li>
        organizational&nbsp;commitment to identify and free-up key staff for the process
    </li>
    <li>
        facilitation of honest and accurate communication about the state of current processes and tools usage
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When providing recommendations for improvement, keep in mind that introducing many changes all at once is rarely
    successful. Plan&nbsp;a few changes, measuring the results, and then undertaking further change based on those results.
</p>
<p>
    For changes to be effective, the people who will need to change their behavior (the actual teams developing
    software)&nbsp; must be involved in the entire assessment and recommendations effort.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Be aware of any potentially conflicting initiatives.
</p>
<p>
    Assessments are typically performed once per year to ensure that the organization's processes are aligned with its
    business and operational objectives.

    <strong>Question</strong>: Content that I am expecting isn't showing up when I publish the configuration.<br />
    <strong>Answer:</strong> Check that the content is checked in the configuration. Whenever plug-ins, folders, or
    processes are added, you need to update configurations to make sure they are included.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Question</strong>:&nbsp;Content is not showing up in&nbsp;navigation views, as expected.<br />
    <strong>Answer</strong>: Confirm that the element has been added to the custom category that represents the navigation
    view. If the custom category is populated using a query, make sure that the element you want added has the necessary
    values to be included. For example, if custom category includes everything with a specific tag, make sure the element
    that would like to see added has been tagged with the necessary tag.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question</strong>:&nbsp;I added glossary terms to a plug-in, but they are not showing up.<br />
    <strong>Answer</strong>: If the plug-in is a "supporting plug-in" then glossary terms will not show up. You may have to
    create both supporting and non-supporting plug-ins to separate content that publishes only when used from content that
    you always want published. For more information on supporting plug-ins, see the Method Composer online help topic:
    <strong>Product overview</strong> &gt; <strong>Introduction to Rational Method Composer</strong> &gt; <strong>Key
    concepts</strong> &gt; <strong>Method plug-in</strong>. The latest information on this topic is also available from the

<p>
    <strong>Question</strong>: I added some roles and work products in a "common" plug-in, and they are showing up in
    configurations where they are not applicable.<br />
    <strong>Answer</strong>: If the roles and work products are in a non-supporting plug-in, then they will show up even
    when not referenced by a specific practice. You may have to create both supporting and non-supporting plug-ins to
    separate content that publishes only when used from content that you always want published. For more information on
    supporting plug-ins, see the Method Composer online help topic: <strong>Product overview</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Introduction to Rational Method Composer</strong> &gt; <strong>Key concepts</strong> &gt; <strong>Method
    plug-in</strong>. The latest information on this topic is also available from the <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/rmchelp/v7r5m1/index.jsp" target="_blank">RMC Information Center</a>.<br />
    <br />
    <strong>Question</strong>: My configuration contains lots of resource errors - what did I do wrong?<br />
    <strong>Answer:</strong> When elements are moved and renamed in the library, configurations are not automatically
    updated. Thus, over time, references in configurations can become invalid. If you are sure your library contains
    everything relevant to the configuration, you can apply the "quick fix" to all such errors.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question</strong>: A field on one of my method elements (such as <strong>Purpose</strong>) is empty, but it
    still appears. I would like for it to be suppressed - what do I do?<br />
    <strong>Answer</strong>: It should be automatically suppressed if empty. Check the HTML tab - there is probably some
    invisible HTML in the field.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question</strong>: I am trying to drag a task from the library view into my process, but it doesn't work.<br />
    <strong>Answer</strong>: You must drag from the configuration view, not the library view.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Question</strong>: I created a task, but I can't find it to add to my process. Where is it?<br />
    <strong>Answer</strong>: Make sure the default configuration for the process includes the plug-in and package where the
    task is defined.&nbsp;

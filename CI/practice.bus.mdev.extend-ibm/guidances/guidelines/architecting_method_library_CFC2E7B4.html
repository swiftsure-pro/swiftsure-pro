    Sketching a Method
</h3>
<p>
    Sketching a method is all about brainstorming about what the method should contain and how it should be
    organized.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Sketching is usually performed in a team environment in the context of a series of brainstorming sessions involving
    method SMEs.
</p>
<p>
    When sketching a method, it is important to identify the key method elements and their relationships, as well as an
    early draft of a brief description. The key method elements may include any or all of the following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Key content areas</strong>, especially if the method is large, and these may evolve into domains and
        disciplines.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Key method content elements and their relationships</strong>: what work products are produced and what
        roles are responsible for them?&nbsp; What work products are consumed by the process (e.g., what are the input work
        products)?
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Key activities</strong>: What activities are performed to produce the work products, what work products do
        those activities produce and consume?
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Overall lifecycle and milestones</strong>.&nbsp;What is the overall lifecycle that you are trying to
        represent, organized by key milestones and milestone criteria?
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When sketching a method, it is important to leverage as much existing content as you can, both from the current
    context, as well as from existing methods.&nbsp;This is especially important if the ultimate objective is to customize
    an existing method for the current context.
</p>
<p>
    The following describes an approach for&nbsp;sketching a method:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify key work products</strong>. Sometimes starting with the key work products can be easiest, as this
        gives you a set of terms to start working with. What are the key work products that are produced? Provide a brief
        description that indicates their purpose and key contents. If the work products have significant state, it is a
        good idea to capture that, as well. In addition to the work products that are produce by the method, it is
        important to identify work products that are consumed by the method. What are the inputs to the method? What is
        their expected contents? Can they be refined in any way, or should they be treated as input only?
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify key activities</strong>. Once you have an initial list of work products, you can turn your
        attention to the key activities that are performed and how those activities produce/consume the work products. If
        they produce or refine a work product, what is the work product's resulting state after the activity is complete?
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Identify key roles</strong>. You can also start thinking about what key roles that participate in the
        process, what work products they are responsible for and any key activities they participate in.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Outline overall lifecycle, including key milestones</strong>. Once you have an idea of the key activities,
        you can start to organize them into an overall lifecycle. First identify the key milestones and describe the
        milestone criteria in terms of the work products produced and their state. You can then map the identified
        activities to the milestones they support (i.e., the activities that support the reaching of the goal of the
        milestone). This may result in additional activities. At this point, don't worry too much about individual tasks,
        just capture the overall lifecycle in terms of milestones, key activities and their affect on key work products.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Applying the above approach results in a high-level definition of an end-to-end process, including work products,
    roles, activities,&nbsp;milestones and overall lifecycle.
</p>
<h3>
    Sketching a Practice
</h3>
<p>
    When sketching a practice, you&nbsp;must first name and briefly describe the practice.&nbsp; Then identify the
    practice's relationship with other practice and with other method framework elements.&nbsp; Specifically, identify
    what&nbsp;work product slots will provide the inputs to the practices what the practice will produce in terms of work
    products and what work product slots those work products will fill.&nbsp; In addition you may want to identify any
    known guidance that will be shared.
</p>
<p>
    Once you have an understanding of&nbsp;how the practice fits into the method framework, you can turn your attention to
    what the practice&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;contain (method content&nbsp;and/or process) and the relationships between these
    practice elements.&nbsp; If known, it is also a good idea to identify where the content will come from so decisions can
    be made about the development of the practice.
</p>
<p>
    Structuring a practice&nbsp;is where the elements of the practice and their relationships are defined. Specifically,
    structuring a practice involves:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Defining the practice -- where the practice fits in the overall practice framework&nbsp;and what are its external
        dependencies
    </li>
    <li>
        Defining the practice elements -- what elements are contained within the practice and what are their relationships
    </li>
    <li>
        Categorizing the practice elements into standard and custom categories
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each of these topics&nbsp;are described in the following sections.
</p>
<h4>
    General practice structuring guidelines
</h4>
<p>
    The practice structure must be developed within the guiding principles and constraints of the practice
    framework&nbsp;in which the practice resides.
</p>
<p>
    When structuring a practice, resist the temptation to enter detailed descriptions into the defined method
    elements.&nbsp;Instead, just name and briefly describe the elements and enter a few outline details, if they help to
    more clearly describe the element's basic definition.&nbsp;For more information, see the topics Method Element Naming
    Conventions and Writing Brief Descriptions in&nbsp;the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/general_naming_conventions_5651B0CC.html" guid="__I8S0D2kEd-lU6YVR9_PJQ">Guideline: General Naming Conventions</a>.
</p>
<p>
    When structuring a practice, be sure to look for opportunities to leverage existing information in core elements and/or
    in other practices.&nbsp;If you find existing method elements in another practice that you would like to share, work
    with the method architects to get the common information moved to&nbsp;the core where it can be shared. Likewise,
    method elements should be defined to maximize reuse.&nbsp;If while structuring a practice you define an element that
    can be shared across practices, it should be defined in&nbsp;in the core where it can be shared, instead of in the
    practice.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Develop a Proof-of-Concept
</h3>
<p>
    The proof-of-concept of a <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/method_content_6972AE81.html" guid="_Ts2joB_MEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">method content</a>&nbsp;should be done using the implementation environment you plan to
    use to author the actual method. That way you can test the technical feasibility of your architectural ideas in the
    actual implementation environment.
</p>
<p>
    The following are some things that you may want to test out:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Your proposed library structure, including the types of plug-ins you are considering creating, their relationships
        and the types of configurations you are considering creating.
    </li>
    <li>
        Strategy for defining navigation views, identifying any common navigation elements that you may want to share
        between views and configurations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Strategy for handling copyrights and release information.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    As you develop the proof-of-concept, it is important to document any issues and risks that you encounter so that these
    can be addressed when more formally defining the method.
</p>
<p>
    When developing an proof-of-concept for a practice framework, be sure to include a set of <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/practice_94B5C550.html" guid="_wxYvkMaGEduMlb2cQZNTYw">practice</a>s, some interfaces between those practices (e.g., <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/work_product_826E4C22.html" guid="_H4JXwB_SEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">work product</a>&nbsp;slots), as well as some configurations representing the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/method_configuration_C2B8FA8A.html" guid="__V7pAMaEEduMlb2cQZNTYw">method configuration</a>s those practices will be included in.&nbsp;You may also want to
    take into consideration any defined plug-in types and/or configuration types.&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Structuring the Practice Framework Core
</h3>
<p>
    Structuring the Practice Framework&nbsp;core is where the core elements of the framework and their relationships are
    defined. The core structure must be developed within the guiding principles and constraints of the practice
    framework&nbsp;in which the core resides.
</p>
<p>
    When structuring a practice, resist the temptation to enter detailed descriptions into the defined core
    elements.&nbsp;Instead, just name and briefly describe the elements and enter a few outline details, if they help to
    more clearly describe the element's basic definition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    When structuring the core elements, be sure to look for opportunities to leverage existing information in other core
    elements (for example, core elements for a specific context may extend, customize and reuse elements from a more
    general core). If you find existing core elements in another context-specific core that you would like to share, work
    with the method architects to get the common information moved to&nbsp;a more general core where it can be shared.
    Likewise, core elements should be defined to maximize reuse.&nbsp;If while structuring the core elements for a specific
    context,&nbsp;you define an element that can be shared across contexts, it should be defined in&nbsp;in a more general
    core where it can be shared.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Core elements are physically packaged in&nbsp;Core plug-ins. For more information on Core plug-ins and what elements
    should be placed in what plug-ins, see [Concept: Practice Library Plug-In Types]. For more information on defining
    plug-ins, see the topic Defining Plug-ins in the&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/creating_plugins_practices_configurations_4C84B4C2.html" guid="_EXvLwD3NEd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Creating Plug-ins, Practices and Configurations</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Structuring the core elements involves:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Defining the Work Product Slot</strong><strong>s</strong>. For more information, see the topic
        Defining&nbsp;Work Product Slots below.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Defining the common method content</strong><strong>&nbsp;elements and their relationships</strong>
        (including shared roles, work products and guidance). For more information, see the "Defining the common method
        content elements" section of this guideline.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Defining the shared standard categories</strong> (e.g., domains and disciplines). For more information, see
        the "Defining shared standard categories" section of this guideline.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Defining the shared custom categories</strong> (including shared navigation views). For more information,
        see the "Defining shared custom categories" section of this guideline.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Additional information on defining these core elements is provided in the following sections.
</p>
<h4>
    Defining a work product slot
</h4>
<p>
    Work Product Slots are defined when you need to pass information between Practices.&nbsp;They are defined in Core
    plug-ins where their definition can be shared.
</p>
<p>
    Work product slots are implemented as work products. However, they are "special" work products in that they are
    implementation/representation agnostic. Thus, for general information on defining work products, see the topic Defining
    Method Content Elements in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It&nbsp;is important to remember that work products slots are not "real" elements, in the method sense.&nbsp;Thus,
    there are some additional authoring guidelines:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Work product slots may appear as inputs to tasks
    </li>
    <li>
        Work product slots may not appear as an output to tasks
    </li>
    <li>
        Work product slots are filled by real work products in specific practices&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Work product slots should not be categorized using standard categories
    </li>
    <li>
        When naming separate work product slots, use a descriptive name that indicates explicitly that the element is a
        slot.&nbsp;Specifically, the slot's presentation name should be between brackets and it's internal name should end
        in ("_slot").&nbsp; Such conventions make it easy to see what is a slot and what is an actual artifact that fills a
        slot.&nbsp;<br />
        For example:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Presentation Name: [Specified System]
            </li>
            <li>
                Name: specified_system_slot
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Defining the common method content elements
</h4>
<p>
    In a practice framework, the common method elements usually include common roles definitions, work product definitions
    and guidance. Tasks are not considered common elements (they defined in specific practices).
</p>
<p>
    The following sections provide core-specific recommendations for defining the common method content elements. For
    general guidelines on defining method content elements, see the topic Defining Method Content Elements in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<h5>
    Defining common work products
</h5>
<p>
    Work product definitions are provided in core to allow practices to share the common definition, even though they may
    use the work product differently (e.g., provide different techniques for producing and consuming the work product).
</p>
<p>
    Work products are not specified as fulfilling specific slots in the core. The fulfillment of slots is defined within
    the practice (not in common).&nbsp;<br />
    Note: Even though common work products are defined in&nbsp;Core, they do not really "exist" as part of the method being
    defined until they are placed in a slot by a practice. In that case, the work product is considered conceptually part
    of that practice.&nbsp;The only reason these work product definitions are physically placed in&nbsp;the core&nbsp;is so
    their definition can be shared.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Work products in the core are generally "state free".&nbsp;Specific work product states are considered
    practice-specific information.
</p>
<p>
    Work products in the core do not have an associated responsible role. What role is responsible for what work product is
    a practice-specific decision.
</p>
<h5>
    Defining common roles
</h5>
<p>
    Practice frameworks generally implement a Delayed Assignment&nbsp;approach for roles and role&nbsp;assignments so the
    role definitions and/or assignments can be easily changed. Common role definitions are included in the core, but they
    are not assigned to work products or tasks. These assignments are defined as part of the practice.
</p>
<h5>
    Defining common guidance
</h5>
<p>
    Common guidance is guidance that can be shared across practices.&nbsp;Such guidance is not associated to any method
    content elements in the core. Such associations are done as part of defining the practice.<br />
    Note: Even though common guidance is defined in&nbsp;the core, such guidance is considered conceptually part of the
    practice where the guidance is associated to specific practice elements.
</p>
<h4>
    Defining shared standard categories
</h4>
<p>
    Standard category definitions (domains, disciplines, work product kinds, role sets, tools) are are generally shared
    across practices, so they are defined in the practice framework core. However, practice frameworks generally implement
    a Delayed Assignment&nbsp;approach for standard categories, except for tools (since what tool mentors are assigned to
    what tools usually does not change). Thus these categories are defined in the core, but elements are not categorized
    using these categories in the core. The categorization happens as part of the practice. For more information on
    categorizing method elements into standard categories, see the topic Categorizing&nbsp;Method Elements Using Standard
    Categories in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/categorizing_7B37E584.html" guid="_kY8j4EH-Ed-bmYzvomIdMg">Guideline: Categorizing</a>.
</p>
<h4>
    Defining shared custom categories
</h4>
<p>
    Custom categories may be defined in the core that can be shared across practices. A common example of a shared custom
    category is a navigation view, but other custom categories may be defined, as well.
</p>
<p>
    Elements are added to the shared custom categories in the core and in practices, as desired. For more information on
    categorizing method elements into custom categories, see the topic Categorizing Method Elements&nbsp;Using
    Custom&nbsp;Categories&nbsp;in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/categorizing_7B37E584.html" guid="_kY8j4EH-Ed-bmYzvomIdMg">Guideline: Categorizing</a>.
</p>
<p>
    These custom categories&nbsp;can then be&nbsp;included, as desired, as part of&nbsp;publishable method configurations.
    For more information on publishable configurations, see [Concept: Practice Library Configuration Types].&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Customizing Practice Framework Core Elements
</h3>
<p>
    Practice Framework&nbsp;core&nbsp;customizations are stored in a separate plug-ins from the&nbsp;core elements being
    customized. Specifically, all core element customizations should be defined in an Extend plug-in for the Core plug-in
    that contains the element to be customized. For more information on Core and Extend plug-ins, see [Concept: Practice
    Library Plug-In Types].
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of different ways that you can customize the practice framework core.&nbsp;You can:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Add a new work product slot
    </li>
    <li>
        Customize an existing work product slot
    </li>
    <li>
        Add a new common method content element (e.g., role, work product or guidance;&nbsp;tasks are&nbsp;generally stored
        in <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/concepts/practice_F5C8EAAB.html" guid="_qhCTAFRREd2CWscN8Mx6rg">Practice</a>s)&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Customize an existing common method content element&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Add new shared domains or disciplines
    </li>
    <li>
        Customize existing shared domains or disciplines
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following sections describe how you would structure these customizations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Add a new work product slot</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to define a new Work Product Slot:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create an Extend plug-in to contain the new slot.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define a new artifact and indicate that it is a slot.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Customize an existing work product slot</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to customize (not just by adding guidance) an existing Work Product Slot:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If one does not exist, create an Extends&nbsp;plug-in to contain the slot customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Customize the slot the same way you customize any work product. However, since slots are shared across practices,
        be sure that they adhere to guidelines for slots and that the changes are applicable across practices. For more
        information on customizing work products, see the topic Customizing a Method Content Element in the&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Add a new common method content element</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to add a new common method content&nbsp;element (e.g., role, work product,
    guidance)&nbsp;to the core (tasks are generally not common, but are considered practice-specific):&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create an Extend plug-in to contain the new common element.<br />
        Note: Practice frameworks generally&nbsp;implement a Delayed Assignment&nbsp;approach for roles, so it is
        recommended that role definitions be placed in their own plug-in.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define the new element.&nbsp;These elements are common so be sure to only include information
        that is common across practices. Do not include any associations between elements as such relationships are
        better-defined in practices. For more information, see the topic Defining Method Content Elements in the&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Customize an existing&nbsp;common method content element</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to customize&nbsp;an existing common method content&nbsp;element (e.g., role, work product,
    guidance)&nbsp;to the core (tasks are generally not common, but are considered practice-specific):
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If one does not exist, create an Extends&nbsp;plug-in to contain the customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Customize the elements the same way you customize any element. However, since common elements are shared across
        practices, be sure to only include information that is common across practices. Do not include any associations
        between elements as such relationships are better-defined in practices. For more information, see the topic
        Customizing a Method Content Element in the&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h4>
    Add a new shared domain or discipline
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to add a new shared domain or discipline:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        If one does not exist, create an Extends&nbsp;plug-in to contain the domain or discipline definitions.<br />
        Note: Practice frameworks generally&nbsp;implement a Delayed Assignment&nbsp;approach for standard categories, so
        it is recommended that domain and discipline definitions be placed in their own plug-in.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define the new standard category. Do not assign any elements to the categories as the
        categorization of elements to standard categories is done in the practices.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Customize existing shared domains or disciplines
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to customize and existing shared domain&nbsp;or discipline:
</p>
<ul class="noindent">
    <li>
        If one does not exist, create an Extends&nbsp;plug-in to contain the domain or discipline customizations.<br />
        Note: Practice frameworks generally&nbsp;implement a Delayed Assignment&nbsp;approach for standard categories, so
        it is recommended that domain and discipline definitions be placed in their own plug-in.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, customize the standard category. Do not add any elements to the categories as the
        categorization of elements to standard categories is done in the practices.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Documenting the Practice Framework Architecture
</h3>
<p>
    Documenting the architecture of a Practice Framework&nbsp;is critical to making sure that key decisions are captured
    and communicated to the development team. Documenting the practice framework architecture involves defining and
    capturing the key guiding principles and a consistent approaches for structuring the framework, as well as documenting
    the key structural elements.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    In general, don't spend much time:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        getting the architecture perfect -- it can evolve over time as the individual method elements are defined and
        detailed.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        providing detailed descriptions of the method elements -- just name and briefly describe the elements and enter a
        few outline details if it helps to more clearly describe the element's basic definition.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Note: While documenting the architecture is important, it is not enough to just define&nbsp;it on paper.&nbsp;It is
    important that the architecturally-significant method elements be actually built using your selected method
    implementation environment.
</p>
<p>
    When documenting the architecture, there are two key decisions that you need to make: what to include in the
    architecture description and what level of detail. Each of these are described in the following sections.
</p>
<h4>
    Architecture content
</h4>
<p>
    The <strong><em>architecturally-significant method elements</em></strong> in a practice framework&nbsp;are the
    following:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Practices<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Core elements: Elements shared across practices:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                Work Product Slots: Information that passes between the practices,
            </li>
            <li>
                Common method content elements (especially, roles, guidance, work products) such as the definitions that
                are shared across practices,
            </li>
            <li>
                Common&nbsp;standard categories (especially domains, disciplines, work product kinds, role sets, tools),
            </li>
            <li>
                Common custom categories.<br />
                &nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Practice Configurations:&nbsp;Assemble practices into usable methods for practitioners
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following are some examples of the <strong><em>types of decisions</em></strong> you might make (and document) when
    architecting a method framework:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use a Delayed Assignment&nbsp;approach for role&nbsp;assignments and standard category assignments (except for
        tools) in order to improve the flexibility and ability to configure the framework
    </li>
    <li>
        Use a specific set of method plug-in&nbsp;and method configuration&nbsp;types in order to provide a consistent
        approach for structuring the framework. We recommend the plug-in types defined in [Concept: Practice Library
        Plug-In Types]&nbsp;and the configuration types defined in [Concept: Practice Library Configuration Types].
    </li>
    <li>
        Follow a consistent set of naming conventions. We recommend the ones&nbsp;defined in&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/general_naming_conventions_5651B0CC.html" guid="__I8S0D2kEd-lU6YVR9_PJQ">Guideline: General Naming Conventions</a>.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide recommendations and constraints for the following:
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        <ul>
            <li>
                How navigation view should be built
            </li>
            <li>
                How standard categorization should be handled (as well as any common standard categories)
            </li>
            <li>
                Approach for assigning roles&nbsp;(as well as any common roles)
            </li>
            <li>
                Approach for scaling elements
            </li>
            <li>
                Approach for associating guidance
            </li>
            <li>
                Approach for dividing the architecture into smaller chunks to reduce complexity
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Level of detail
</h4>
<p>
    There is a range of&nbsp;options for the information that can be captured in an architecture description. In some
    cases, where there is an architectural decision to be made, there are a set of architecture notes that are written up
    proposing what to do, discussing all the choices and the tradeoffs that have been made. These notes can be an email
    thread, a forum thread, or a wiki. Then, the final decision is captured in an architecture document. The notes serve as
    a historical record of decisions (if you keep them) and not a polished, maintained view of the architecture. The
    maintained architecture document is a separate work product that is mainly targeted at new developers and maintainers
    of the system, and to ensure the architecture does not degrade. The notes get filed in a notebook for later reference
    in case people are curious why the team did something.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the following are the range of options for the architecture documentation:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Keep a set of notes that are a historical collection of architecture notes that are not maintained
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep a set of notes, plus define a high-level overview of the architecture
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep a set of notes, an architectural overview, plus a set of distilled key decisions
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep a set of notes, an architectural overview, a set of distilled key decisions and a set of evolutionary models
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep a set of notes, an architectural overview, a set of distilled key decisions and a set of formal models at
        different levels of abstraction
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    For each project, it is important to decide which of the above options makes the most sense.

    A&nbsp; practice a documented approach to solving one or several commonly occurring problems. Practices are intended as
    "chunks" of process for adoption, enablement, and configuration. Practices are built from the basic method
    elements.&nbsp; Practices can be informally document through one white paper, or formally documented through a
    combination of training courses, tutorials, process content, redbooks, etc.&nbsp; Practices provide one-stop-shopping
    for relevant content
</p>
<h3>
    Why Practices?
</h3>
<p>
    Practices enable a new approach to building methods - practice composition.
</p>
<p>
    This approach offers the following benefits:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Focused on business results
    </li>
    <li>
        Reusability, adaptability and scalability
    </li>
    <li>
        Incremental adoption
    </li>
    <li>
        Easy to configure and use
    </li>
    <li>
        Community development
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Focused on Business Results
</h3>
<p>
    Practices <em><strong>focus on results</strong></em> (provided capabilities and resulting work products). They
    translate ideas into action and deliver high value. Practices are refined based on experiences and lessons learned
    ("practice makes perfect!").&nbsp; Practices focus on what matters (e.g., what practices should we use to meet our
    business objectives vs what process is "best").
</p>
<p>
    A practice has a <strong><em>positive impact on one or several business objectives</em></strong> (e.g., Time-to-Market,
    Improve Quality, Increase Innovation, etc.).&nbsp; The adoption of a practice, and it's impact on business objectives,
    can be effectively <em><strong>measured</strong>.</em><br />
</p>
<h3>
    Reusability, Adaptability and Scalability
</h3>
<p>
    A practice is a <strong><em>reusable</em></strong> and <strong><em>scalable</em></strong> process package that&nbsp;may
    be general, domain-specific, technique-specific, organization-specific, etc. Practices can be extended/enhanced by
    other practices and/or techniques.&nbsp; Practices can be adapted to&nbsp;support a range of solutions.&nbsp;In
    particular, practices can be adapted to suit your organization and supplemented by your own practices.
</p>
<p>
    The core practices are the open source EPF Practices.&nbsp;These practices are based on a common framework that allows
    them to be composed.&nbsp; The core practices&nbsp;are tool-agnostic, low-ceremony practices that can be extended to
    address a broad variety of development concerns, such as SOA, geographical distribution, model-driven architecture and
    embedded systems. Tool and technology specific guidance can be added, such as guidance on J2EE, and a variety of
    development tools. Some of these extensions can be quite modest, adding&nbsp;for example&nbsp;just tool specific
    guidance to existing tasks, while others can be comprehensive, defining processes that provide a radically expanded
    scope with new or altered artifacts, new or altered tasks, and new or altered roles.
</p>
<p>
    Extensions and additions to&nbsp;the practices&nbsp;can be:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        used internally by an organization
    </li>
    <li>
        open sourced as a part of the EPF project
    </li>
    <li>
        sold commercially as an extension to the basic framework, such as the IBM(R) Practices.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Incremental Adoption
</h3>
<p>
    A practice is a component or aspect of a process that can be <strong><em>adopted independently</em></strong>
    <strong><em>and incrementally</em></strong> by an organization to build an organizational capability. Practices support
    easier adoption of lighter processes.&nbsp; Organizations only use what they really need. They can adopt one or a few
    practice at a time and/or adopt a practice at higher levels over time (evolutionary and incremental
    adoption).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Incremental adoption is supported by the&nbsp;fact that&nbsp;each practice is described as a standalone
    capability&nbsp;and&nbsp;provides one-stop-shopping for all collateral related to the practice -- e.g.,&nbsp; courses,
    tool features, services, articles, process content, enactment, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Easy to Configure and Use
</h3>
<p>
    Practices are designed to be <strong><em>interchangeable</em></strong>, they may be mixed and matched or swapped out
    for alternative practices. Practice-based techniques recognize that "one-size fits all" is too limiting for
    processes.&nbsp; Practices allow alternatives.&nbsp; Creating a method is as simple as selecting the practices that you
    wish to adopt, and then publishing the results.&nbsp;Each practice adds itself into the framework so that content can
    be viewed by practice, or across practices by work product, role, task and so on.
</p>
<h3>
    Community Development
</h3>
<p>
    Since a practice can be easily authored on its own, practices are ideal for community development.&nbsp;The basic agile
    practices for the&nbsp;EPF Practices are, in fact, developed by the Eclipse Process Framework community.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Practices enable a&nbsp;richer eco-system as it is easier to develop an individual&nbsp;practice than to author an
    entire method.

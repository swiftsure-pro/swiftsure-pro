    Detailing Method Elements

<p>
    <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">When detailing method elements, be sure to:</span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Use the individual fields of the method element (and associated guidance) instead of putting all the details in the
        Main description field. This&nbsp;separates and simplifies the detailed text so the reader can easily focus on the
        information they're interested in. Specifically, use the Brief Description or Purpose sections of method content to
        state the purpose or conclusion of the idea that's being communicated. Use the remaining sections to provide a
        detailed explanation of the subject. A method element should immediately communicates the specific idea that's
        being described. Reading the rest of the sections is useful to understand the detail of the subject.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keep text sparse to allow the reader to quickly scan and locate the information they want.
    </li>
    <li>
        Document process-dependent information separate from the method content element definition.&nbsp;Method
        content&nbsp;elements should&nbsp;be process independent. Any minor differences/tweaks to the elements based on
        where they occur in&nbsp;a particular process or lifecycle&nbsp;can be captured in the processes in which the
        element appears (more on this below). This maximizes the reuse of the method content across processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Define associations to guidance, not just hyperlinks in the text.&nbsp;If you link to other guidance from the HTML
        of a guidance element, define an association from the guidance element to the guidance you are referring
        to.&nbsp;This ensures that Method Composer will help flag those cases where the referenced guidance is not included
        in the configuration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Adhere to the recommended guidelines for textual content.&nbsp;See Formatting and Writing Tips for Method Authors].
    </li>
    <li>
        Capture the source of the information being included in the element. This information is important if you ever need
        to provide source information for the element for documenting ownership rights.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Maintain version histories.&nbsp;For more information, see Guideline: Maintaining Change Histories and Version
        Numbers].&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Method elements can be detailed using templates.&nbsp;For more information, see topic Detailing Method Content Using
    Templates in <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/creating_plugins_practices_configurations_4C84B4C2.html" guid="_EXvLwD3NEd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Creating Plug-ins, Practices and Configurations</a>.

<h3>
    Detailing Common Method Element Fields
</h3>
<p>
    In general, use the individual method element properties to capture specific information about the element.&nbsp;This
    simplifies the text so that&nbsp;the reader can easily focus on the information they're interested in.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>General information</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Name</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Presentation Name</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Brief Description</strong><br />
        For information on these topics, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/general_naming_conventions_5651B0CC.html" guid="__I8S0D2kEd-lU6YVR9_PJQ">Guideline: General Naming Conventions</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Detail information</strong>:
</p>
<p>
    Use the Purpose and Description sections of method element to state the purpose or conclusion of the idea that's being
    communicated. Use the remaining sections to provide a detailed explanation of the subject.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Purpose</strong>: Describes the reason for the method element.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Main description</strong>: Provides an extended description that explains what the method element is beyond
        what is covered elsewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Key considerations</strong>: Contains useful material that does not easily fit into any of the other
        sections, such as advice and guidance of a critical nature. as well as warnings, cautions, pitfalls and dangers
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Version information</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><strong>Version</strong>: The version number of the element.&nbsp;In many cases,
        versioning is done at the plug-in level, rather than at the individual element level.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Change date</strong>: Today's date is entered by clicking in the field. It cannot be removed.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Change description</strong>: Enter any free-form text. The history of these descriptions is
        maintained.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Authors</strong>: Identify the author(s) of this content.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Copyright</strong>: The element's copyright.&nbsp;This is generally only completed for the plug-in, since
        every element gets the plug-in's copyright, unless it is overridden for a particular element.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>Icon</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Shape icon:</strong> Specify the icon to be displayed in the upper left of the content page when published.
        Define a new icon or use one from another plug-in.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Node icon:</strong> Specify the icon displayed by this node in the tree view of the published site. Define
        a new icon or use one from another plug-in.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Detailing Practice Elements
</h3>
<p>
    Detailing a&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/concepts/practice_F5C8EAAB.html" guid="_qhCTAFRREd2CWscN8Mx6rg">Practice</a>&nbsp;is all about fleshing out the details of the individual practice
    elements.
</p>
<p>
    All&nbsp;practice detailing work must adhere to the constraints defined for the Practice Framework&nbsp;and for the
    practice&nbsp;itself.
</p>
<p>
    When detailing any element that physically resides in a practice, do not refer to elements outside of the
    practice.<br />
    Exception: practice elements may refer to Work Product Slots and other core elements.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the method elements included in a practice (for example, tasks, guidance, and so on), every practice
    should include the following guidance elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        how-to-adopt <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/roadmap_466C36E0.html" guid="_19dWYMaHEduMlb2cQZNTYw">roadmap</a>: describes how to adopt the practice
    </li>
    <li>

    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Detailing practice elements in the UMF
</h4>
<p>
    When detailing the elements in a practice&nbsp;that exists within the Unified Method Framework (UMF), you must take
    into consideration the UMF practice conventions.&nbsp;When detailing the elements in a practice, you may find that you
    need to make changes to an element in a&nbsp;Core plug-in. Specifically, you may find that you have content
    that&nbsp;would be better shared between practices (for example, a common work product, some shared guidance, or a new
    role) and thus you may need to add a new core element or refine an existing core element.
</p>
<h3>
    Detailing Work Products

<p>
    This&nbsp;topic provides guidance for detailing <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/work_product_826E4C22.html" guid="_H4JXwB_SEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">work product</a>s (<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/artifact_F635D25.html" guid="_x7cUM9nmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">artifact</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/outcome_797E7695.html" guid="_LNAAcB_iEdqAHrsQ7-jSbw">outcome</a>s and <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/deliverable_BFE1A5A9.html" guid="_yFbWoNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">deliverable</a>s).&nbsp;

            available, what would be the impact to the execution of the project? What information would the practitioners

<h4>
    Detailing artifacts
</h4>
<p>
    The following fields are artifact-specific:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Brief outline:</strong> This field is optional.&nbsp;It describes the major sections or information topics
        that are covered by the work product.&nbsp;This information&nbsp;should be generic,&nbsp;in other words,&nbsp;not
        specific to any particular format or template.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Selected representation</strong>: This field is optional.&nbsp;It is used when a particular representation
        is decided on. For example, a particular company may mandate the use of a particular tool or format.&nbsp;<br />
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Notation</strong>: This field is optional.&nbsp;It describes any notations used by the work product. Either
        <strong>Brief outline</strong> or <strong>Notation</strong> should be provided, or both [*** I got this last
        sentence from the template, but I am not sure what&nbsp;it means.&nbsp; Should it be "not both"? ***]&nbsp; This
        field may also contain explanations of any diagrammatic or textual notations. Include notations that are important
        or special terms, labels, headers, acronyms, etc. that are used in the artifact. Any items relating to how this is
        implemented in a specific template should be included in the description for that template, not here. Note this
        section should be general enough to apply regardless of the actual representation option selected, unless there are
        multiple notations such as IDEF1X or UML, in which case an overview of each can be included (preferably as
        contributions&nbsp;from the related techniques).<br />
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Representation options</strong>: This field is optional.&nbsp;Describe alternative representations for this
        work product.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Detailing deliverables
</h4>
<p>
    The following fields are deliverable-specific:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>External Description</strong>: This field is intended to be a description of the deliverable that the
        client will read. It is usually copied into a Statement of Work or other agreement, or into sales and marketing
        material. The content of this field may require legal approval of some sort. Seek guidance from the method
        authoring consultant. Keep to a description (what the deliverable is) rather than its use in an engagement. Build
        on the purpose but differentiate between the what and the why of the deliverable. The description is about what the
        deliverable is. The description must be understood by potential clients.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Packaging Guidance</strong>: This field is intended to give an overview of the notation for the
        deliverable. For a root deliverable from which other will be derived, the packaging guidance should indicate the
        preferred notations. Note the plural here in that there may be several notations. The packaging guidance should
        provide a synopsis of them. For derived deliverables, variability can add details to notation and they can become
        more focused. The packaging guidance must account for the availability (or not) of a complete set of input work
        products. Depending on the configuration tailoring on a particular engagement, all input work product may not be
        available. Be aware of the purpose and governance level of the deliverable being defined when outlining notation.
        Describe how the inputs are assembled into a deliverable, including what particular sections may be relevant and
        what the expected state of those inputs should be.<br />
        It is often best to define formatting guidelines that apply to all deliverables on the project, and then provide
        additional specific guidelines as needed.&nbsp; It is also best to define formatting guidelines by customizing
        standard formatting guidelines that already exist.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Deliverable Parts:</strong>&nbsp;Identify the work products that will be used to construct the deliverable.
    </li>
</ul><br />
<h3>
    Detailing Tasks
</h3>
<p dir="ltr">
    In general, when detailing a tasks (and task steps), provide specific instructions (i.e., prescriptive text). Most text
    should focus on what needs to be done to accomplish the task (or an individual step of&nbsp;the task). Avoid long
    descriptions of motivations, reasons, and philosophy. Avoid descriptions that sell the importance of what needs to be
    done or motivates the steps that need to be performed. Motivations and explanations are placed in guidance such as
    concepts and supporting materials. Use guidance such as guidelines to provide detailed descriptions of how to perform
    steps, or to provide steps for alternative circumstances. These motivations can be referenced or linked from the
    prescriptive text.

    Writing Tasks
</h3>
<p>
    Provide specific instructions – prescriptive text – to perform tasks, activities, and road maps. Most text should focus
    on what needs to be done to accomplish the step. Avoid long descriptions of motivations, reasons, and philosophy.
    Focusing on "what to do" in tasks, activities, and road maps. Avoid descriptions that sell the importance of what needs
    to be done or motivates the steps that need to be performed. Motivations and explanations are placed in guidances such
    as concepts and supporting materials. Use guidances such as guidelines to provide detailed descriptions of how to
    perform steps, or to provide steps for alternative circumstances. These motivations can be referenced or linked from
    the prescriptive text.
</p>
<p>
    When writing steps for tasks, activities, and road maps focus on:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The steps that need to be performed
    </li>
    <li>
        The conditions or states that need to be achieved
    </li>
    <li>
        Environmental issues that may need to be overcome
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <br />
    This information could also be maintained and referenced in a separate plug-in. For example, a Globally Distributed
    Team plug-in could be created that contains the required guidance. Tasks could be extended through the contribution
    mechanism to reference the guidelines in the plug-in.
</p>
<h4>
    Prescriptive text examples
</h4>
<p>
    This is an example of a single step in a task. At first glance it appears prescriptive:
</p>
<p>
    <em>Step: Determine Architectural Impact</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>For each change request, the Architect examines the product architecture and determines if an architectural change
    needs to be made. The architecture must be clearly defined to perform this step. Usually, the architecture has been
    defined and implemented in the Elaboration iteration of a previous development cycle. If a Software Architecture
    Document doesn't exist it may be necessary to reverse- engineer the architecture so this task can be performed. The
    time taken to reverse-engineer the architecture can be attributed to perfective maintenance. Acquiring a clear
    description of the architecture extends the maintainable life of a software system.</em>
</p>
<p>
    <em>Look for behavioral and structural changes such as:</em>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <em>Architecturally significant flows that must be changed.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Critical interfaces that must be re-implemented.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>New interfaces that must be created that will be utilized by a significant percentage of the system.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Important data transformations that are added, removed, or need to be moved to another part of the system.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>New generalization dependencies that may be required.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Generalization dependences that will disappear, for example a parent-child relationship that will be removed
        when a new pattern is applied.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Operation signature changes that occur on heavily used interfaces.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>Upgrades to non-functional aspects of the system (performance, security, usability, etc)</em>
    </li>
    <li>
        <em>System interface changes that cause other system components to change</em>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Analysis
</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        "For each change request, the Architect examines the product architecture and determines if an architectural change
        needs to be made." What the architect really does is "determine if an architectural change needs to be made". The
        text "examines the product architecture" is vague and doesn't really add much for a seasoned practitioner. If there
        is a technique to be applied, it belongs in a guideline.
    </li>
    <li>
        "The architecture must be clearly defined to perform this step." This doesn't help the seasoned practitioner. It
        doesn't say why the architecture wouldn't be clearly defined (presumably in the final process an architecture has
        been defined), or what to do if the architecture is not clearly defined. If there is some guidance on how to deal
        with architectural issues when no architectural description exists, then that should be provided in a guideline.
    </li>
    <li>
        "Usually, the architecture has been defined and implemented in the Elaboration iteration of a previous development
        cycle." This presumably has been done, so stating it in this step is redundant and reduces the clarity of what the
        step. It also assumes a particular lifecycle is being used in the practice. Practices should avoid assuming a
        particular lifecycle is being used so the practice is reusable.
    </li>
    <li>
        "If a Software Architecture Document doesn't exist it may be necessary to reverse-engineer the architecture so this
        task can be performed." This is another pre-requisite. It's also something that only needs to be done once so it
        shouldn't be part of a step that is repeated like this one (once for each change request). It should probably be
        placed in a task that's performed at the beginning of the Elaboration phase.
    </li>
    <li>
        "The time taken to reverse-engineer the architecture can be attributed to perfective maintenance. Acquiring a clear
        description of the architecture extends the maintainable life of a software system." This is useful motivation but
        it's not prescriptive so it doesn't belong in the task step. It should be in a concept referenced from a step that
        indicates when reverse-engineering should be performed.
    </li>
    <li>
        "Look for behavioral and structural changes such as..." These bullet points are not about the goal of the step, and
        so are good candidates for moving to a guideline.
    </li>
</ol>
<h4>
    Here's the improved step:
</h4>
<p>
    <em>Step: Determine Architectural Impact<br />
    The Architect reviews each change request and determines if an architectural change is required to implement it. See
    the guideline "Determining Architectural Impact" for information on how to identify changes that may have a significant
    impact on the architecture.</em>

    Writing Tool Mentors
</h3>
<p>
    Write <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/tool_mentor_264766F3.html" guid="_yYy-mdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">tool mentors</a> with a specific goal or intent in mind. Often the best way to do this
    is to tightly link the tool mentor with task steps or a guideline. Tasks describe what need to be done, and guidelines
    describe how to do something. Both types of elements are goal oriented and can gain value from tool support.
</p>
<p>
    Tool mentors take the perspective&nbsp;that the reader should use&nbsp;a tool to&nbsp;achieve a specific objective that
    provides some value. This is much like the intent of a use case. Take advantage of this similarity by leveraging use
    case techniques to create a tool mentor. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Identify the tool mentor and stakeholder. Focus on what the stakeholder's objectives are.&nbsp; Use this
        information to create the brief description.
    </li>
    <li>
        Outline the tool mentor. Follow the task steps or the timeline in a guideline to help&nbsp;order the
        outline.&nbsp;The reader should&nbsp;understand what they need to do with the tool at each step. Make sure the
        reader achieves their objective by the time they reach the last&nbsp;step of&nbsp;the tool mentor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Handle problems and issues that could arise. Assure the reader understands what to do if they get unexpected
        results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Detail the tool mentor. Include references to help text whenever appropriate. It's common to reference specific
        information in the product help text at almost every step of the tool mentor.
    </li>
    <li>
        Review the tool mentor and assure that it's clear how to achieve the reader's objective. The transition between the
        task or guideline and the tool mentor should be clean. The reader shouldn't see anything unusual or surprising when
        moving from the task/guideline to the tool mentor.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Always use a Tool Mentor guidance type to write a tool mentor. Don't add tool information directly to tasks,
    guidelines, work products, etc. This keeps tooling information separate from the process content (see below).
</p>
<h4>
    Tool mentors and help text
</h4>
<p>
    Don't use tool mentors as Help Text. Help Text is shipped as part of the associated product and describes what features
    do and how to use them. Tool mentors focus on achieving a goal, while Help Text describes how to use specific features
    and functions of a product. Reference the help as often as necessary in the tool mentor, but don't supplement or
    duplicate the help text.

    Categorize the tool mentors properly in the plug-ins using Standard Categories. See Guideline: Categorizing Method
    Elements Using Standard Categories.

<p>
    See Guideline: Tool Information in the UMF&nbsp;for information on placing the tool mentor content in plug-ins to
    conform with UMF.
</p>
<p>
    Method content is usually written to be tool agnostic. Tool mentors provide tool-specific information and are
    structured so they they can be easily removed from a published configuration. This has two benefits:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Users&nbsp;can perform steps manually or add their own tooling information if they don't own IBM tools.
    </li>
    <li>
        We can manage tool information independently of content so it's easier to address new features, add new tools, and
        remove tools that have been end-of-lifed.
    </li>
</ol>

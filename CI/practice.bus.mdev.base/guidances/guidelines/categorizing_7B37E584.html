    Categorizing Method Elements Using Standard Categories
</h3>
<p>
    Standard Categories provide a means to categorize core method content in line with the best practices for creating
    structured methods. Standard Categories are linked to a specific method content type.&nbsp; The Standard Category types
    are:
</p>
<ul dir="ltr">

        environment. A task can belong to only one discipline.&nbsp; For example, on a software development project, it is
        common to perform certain requirements tasks in close coordination with analysis and design tasks. Separating these
        tasks into separate disciplines makes the tasks easier to comprehend. Disciplines can be organized using Discipline
        Groupings.<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li style="LIST-STYLE-TYPE: none">
        Initial recommendations are to develop separate discipline groupings for each major context and standardize on the
        set of disciplines within that context, allowing for overlap between contexts where appropriate. While disciplines
        may have many similarities to domains for some areas, no formal relationship between the two has been defined.
        Disciplines are currently intended to be independent of role sets.<br />

    You should define a standard category any time you have a need to categorize method elements.&nbsp; Multiple levels of
    categories are possible, but you should only define what you need to manage your method content.&nbsp; For example, if
    your method only contains&nbsp;two tasks, do you really need a discipline?
</p>
<p>
    An important part of defining an element is naming it.&nbsp; For recommendations on naming standard categories, see
    topic Method Element Naming Conventions in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/general_naming_conventions_5651B0CC.html" guid="__I8S0D2kEd-lU6YVR9_PJQ">Guideline: General Naming Conventions</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You may also want to capture guidance on how to decide what tasks belong in the discipline in the <strong>Key
    considerations</strong> property of the category.
</p>
<p>
    Once the categories are defined, method elements can be assigned to them and the resulting categories can be used to
    access the information in the method, as well as in custom categories as part of navigation views.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Standard categories cannot be packaged in separate packages in plug-ins, thus alternative categorization schemes must
    be defined in separate plug-ins.
</p>
<p>
    Guidance can also be associated with standard categories. Such guidance should be applicable to the category as a
    whole,&nbsp;and should not be all guidance that is associated with each of the elements categorized to that category.
</p>
<h3>
    Customizing a Standard Categories&nbsp;
</h3>
<p>
    It is assumed that the&nbsp;standard category&nbsp;(e.g., <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/domain_D8238B93.html" guid="_yHEVYdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">domain</a>&nbsp;or <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/discipline_7667F451.html" guid="_yGUuidnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">discipline</a>) being customized cannot be modified directly. Thus, all changes must be
    stored in a separate plug-in from the&nbsp;standard category being customized. To see the resulting changes, you need
    to browse or publish a configuration that includes the original standard category plus the customizations. If&nbsp;you
    can modify the standard category directly, you should follow the guidelines described in the topic Categorizing Method
    Elements Using Standard Categories below.
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of different ways that you can customize an existing standard category.&nbsp;You can:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Assign elements to the category
    </li>
    <li>
        Remove elements from the category
    </li>
    <li>
        Replace an existing standard category with a new standard category
    </li>
    <li>
        Rename the standard category
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Specific standard category customization scenarios are described in the remaining sections of this guideline.
</p>
<h4>
    Assign elements to the category
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to add a method element to an existing standard category:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create a plug-in to contain the standard category customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define a standard category that contributes to the existing standard category and assign the
        new elements. For more information on contribution, see the topic Using Method Content Variability in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Remove elements from the category
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to remove a method element from an existing standard category:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create a plug-in to contain the standard category customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define a standard category and assign the same elements as in the original standard category,
        except for the element you want to remove.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change the definition of the new standard category to extends-replace the original standard category.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Replace an existing standard category with a new&nbsp;standard category
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to replace an existing standard category with a new standard category:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create a plug-in to contain the standard category customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define the standard category and assign the desired elements.
    </li>
    <li>
        Change the definition of the new standard category to replace the original standard category.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Rename an existing standard category
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to rename an existing standard category:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create a plug-in to contain the standard category customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define a standard category and give it the desired presentation name. Specify that the new
        standard category is to extend-replace the existing standard category.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Standard Categories in the UMF
</h3>
<p>
    The Unified Method Framework (UMF)&nbsp;defines some constraints with regards to the definition and use of standard
    categories.&nbsp;Those constraints vary for the different standard category types.
</p>
<p>
    The UMF implements a Delayed Assignment&nbsp;approach for <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/discipline_7667F451.html" guid="_yGUuidnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">discipline</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/domain_D8238B93.html" guid="_yHEVYdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">domain</a>s and <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/work_product_kind_F04A382B.html" guid="_QWhfYMaJEduMlb2cQZNTYw">work product kind</a>s.&nbsp;It does not implement&nbsp;a delayed category assignment
    for <strong>role sets</strong> because the definition of roles and role sets are strongly linked.&nbsp;Roles are
    assigned to role sets in the same plug-in as where the roles are defined, the Role Definition plug-in (their
    definitions are shared).&nbsp;For more information on roles in the UMF, see the topic Roles in the UMF in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>. The UMF also does not implement&nbsp;a delayed
    category assignment for <strong>tools</strong> because the assignment of tool mentors to tools does not change (tool
    mentors are written for&nbsp;a specific tool).&nbsp;For more information on tools in the UMF, see the
    topic&nbsp;Tool&nbsp;Information in the UMF in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
    The "delayed standard categories" (disciplines, domains and work product kinds) are <strong><em>defined</em></strong>
    in a Category Definition Base plug-in.&nbsp;Elements are <em><strong>assigned</strong></em> to these categories in the
    Assign plug-ins associated with the Base plug-in that contains the elements to be assigned (tasks and work
    products).&nbsp;For information on how these assignments are defined, see the topic Delayed Assignment in the UMF in
    the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    The benefits to the UMF approach to standard categories are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The same categories can be used with different element assignments (shared Category Definition plug-ins)
    </li>
    <li>
        Alternate category definitions and element assignments can be defined (provide alternate Category Definition and

<h3>
    Defining Navigation Views
</h3>
<p>
    This guideline provides recommendations on how to use custom categories to define navigation views. For general
    information on custom categories, see the topic Categorizing Method Elements Using Custom Categories below.
</p>
<p>
    Navigation views are defined as custom categories that define the structure and content of the published method. In
    general, the following are some criteria that affect how you define navigation views for your method:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Number of elements: The more elements you have, the more there is a need to organize them for easy navigation
    </li>
    <li>
        Published representation of the method: How do consumers of the method want to navigate the published
        method.&nbsp;Define navigation views to support the desired navigation paths.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    When defining navigation views, it is important to consider the intended audience and usage model of the
    view,&nbsp;since this will drive the overall organization/hierarchy of the view. For example, will the view be
    organized by element type or by process area?&nbsp;This information can be captured in the description of the custom
    category itself.&nbsp;Such information will be helpful to the person who may may want to consider including the
    navigation view in their configuration for publication.
</p>
<p>
    When defining the navigation views, it is a good idea to create a navigation views that represents a natural reading
    sequence.&nbsp;The guideline to the user would be: "Yes, you CAN click on the links within pages, but that's only if
    you want to jump to another location in the website, or do some free exploration. If you want to read the material in
    the recommended order, and make sure you didn't miss anything, then use this navigation view".&nbsp;In such a "natural
    reading sequence" navigation view,&nbsp;&nbsp;each topic should appear only once.&nbsp;The benefits of this approach
    are:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        You can print the configuration
    </li>
    <li>
        You can browse the expanded tree to find a topic (rather than use the "search" feature)
    </li>
    <li>
        You can look for information by logically figuring out what category it logically belongs to.&nbsp;That way even
        if&nbsp;you&nbsp;don't know the name of a page,&nbsp;you can find it by expanding the appropriate nodes in the
        navigation view.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The following are some navigation views that you my want to consider defining for your method:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Welcome</strong> view: Includes a Welcome page, as well as About and What's New pages.&nbsp;Provides a
        starting point for first time users, no matter what their role.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Getting Started</strong> view: Provides quick access to key concepts, Web site structure&nbsp;and usage
        information for the new user.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Key Elements</strong> view: Provides quick access to the key elements of the method -- processes, roles,
        tasks, work products and processes (it is assumed that guidance is accessible from those
        elements).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Team</strong> view: Provides access to all elements in the configuration, organized by method element type
        and then by category.&nbsp;This views serves as a type of index to all elements in the method.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Role-based</strong> views: Provides access to the elements of most interest to the role .&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Process-based</strong> views: Provides access to the elements that support the process.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Organization/Project-based</strong> views: Provides access the the elements of most interest to the
        organization/project.&nbsp;This view&nbsp;connects the abstractness of the method (content elements and guidance)
        with the concreteness of project life (physical work products) and encourages the team to live the process. It is
        minimalist and thus largely artifact-based, but may also include: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Links to the current version of artifacts
            </li>
            <li>
                Elements of the development case,
            </li>
            <li>
                Selected guidance
            </li>
            <li>
                Project team information
            </li>
            <li>
                Change Request information
            </li>
            <li>
                Discussion forums
            </li>

<h3>
    Navigation views in the UMF
</h3>
<p>
    The Unified Method Framework (UMF)&nbsp;defines two types of navigation view elements:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Configuration-specific</strong>, meaning they are intended to be published as part of a specific
        configuration
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Common</strong>, meaning they are intended to be shared across plug-ins and configurations. The UMF defines
        <em>navigation view building blocks</em>, which are intended to be used across navigation views, as well as generic
        navigation views that can be used as-is or in parts in other navigation views.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Where the navigation view elements are defined and how elements are assigned to them is different for each.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Navigation view building blocks</strong> are elements that may be used across a number of navigation
    views.&nbsp;The UMF navigation view building blocks categorize method elements by "types" as defined in the meta model
    (i.e., <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/role_37A0C602.html" guid="_yUefQNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">role</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/task_6C1FF051.html" guid="_x459ktnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">task</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/artifact_F635D25.html" guid="_x7cUM9nmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">artifact</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/deliverable_BFE1A5A9.html" guid="_yFbWoNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">deliverable</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/outcome_797E7695.html" guid="_LNAAcB_iEdqAHrsQ7-jSbw">outcome</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/checklist_D780FDF.html" guid="_7vpJsMaCEduMlb2cQZNTYw">checklist</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/guideline_1D590B95.html" guid="_uK8HMMaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">guideline</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html" guid="_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">capability pattern</a>s, <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/delivery_process_BCDF50B7.html" guid="_ZufeMCO3EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">delivery process</a>es, etc), as well as some other key ones (e.g., release
    information).&nbsp;The navigation view building blocks are defined as <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/custom_category_554AC4D6.html" guid="_eqw94MaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">custom categories</a>&nbsp;in Navigation View Definition plug-ins, where they can be
    shared across plug-ins. If you want to define additional navigation view building blocks, define an Extends plug-in
    that includes the new building blocks and include the new building blocks in a custom category that contributes to the
    base navigation view building blocks custom category.&nbsp;Using such "super custom categories" will keep the list of
    top-level custom categories from getting too long.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Generic navigation views</strong> are navigation views that may be applicable in multiple
    configurations.&nbsp;They are also defined as custom categories in Navigation View Definition plug-ins, where they can
    be shared across plug-ins.&nbsp;Generic navigation views assemble navigation view building blocks into something that
    can be used as a whole or in parts as a publishable navigation view.&nbsp;For example, a generic navigation view can be
    used to provide a view of everything in the configuration. These navigation views can be used for specific method
    configurations as-is, or tweaked to address the specific needs of the configuration (e.g., extend/replace it or ignore
    and build their own).&nbsp;The benefits of sharing navigation view elements is that you automatically get consistent
    navigation views.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Configuration-specific navigation views</strong> are defined as custom categories in the Publish plug-in for
    the configuration that is to be published.&nbsp;The configuration-specific navigation views indicate what elements
    elements (or navigation view building blocks) are to be included.&nbsp;When defining a configuration-specific
    navigation view, you can:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Create a new view using existing navigation view elements
    </li>
    <li>
        Reuse the common generic navigation view, replacing and/or adding to selected elements, as needed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Custom categories that are designed to be navigation views should include "view" in the name.&nbsp;Also, the custom
    categories that represent the navigation view tabs for the configuration should be "packaged" in a parent custom
    category with "view tabs" in the name.&nbsp;This makes it easy to identify the custom categories that have been
    designed to serve as the navigation views for the configuration.
</p>
<p>
    <br />
</p>
<p>
    The UMF also defines a <strong>"Do Not Publish" category</strong>. It is also defined as a custom category in
    Navigation View Definition Base plug-ins, where it can be shared across plug-ins.&nbsp;Plug-ins can map specific method
    elements to this custom category to keep the elements from being published. This category is especially useful for
    publish plug-ins that are constructing custom views for publishing.&nbsp;The elements in&nbsp;this category should be
    removed from all publishable configurations.&nbsp;For more information on publishable configurations, see [Concept:
    Practice Library Configuration Types].
</p>
<p>
    For more information on the UMF plug-in types (e.g., Navigation View Definition plug-ins, Publish plug-ins, etc.), see
    [Concept: Practice Library Plug-In Types].

<h3>
    Navigation Views in the IBM UMF
</h3>
<p>
    RMC 7.5 (not EPF Composer) has a feature for "tag-based queries" that provides some additional improvements to the
    common navigation view elements.&nbsp; Using that feature, specific method elements can be tagged with a special key
    word which is then included as part of a query in a custom category, where the results of the query populate the custom
    category.
</p>
<p>
    The following are some specific ways in which that feature has been leveraged in the UMF content:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Release information</strong>: "Release information" is not a type, so we can't use the "Include elements of
        type" feature in the base common navigation view element. So instead, we tag all release information method
        elements with a "release_info" tag and then replace the placeholder common navigation view element with a custom
        category that does a tag-based query.&nbsp;<u><em>[*** I checked and none of the practice release information is
        tagged.&nbsp; ***]</em></u>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Structured practice list</strong>.&nbsp; We tagged all technical practices with&nbsp;a "technical" tag and
        defined a "technical practice list" custom category that does a tag-based query on "technical".&nbsp; We tagged all
        management practices with&nbsp;a "management" tag and defined a "management practice list" custom category that
        does a tag-based query on "management".&nbsp; We then replaced the "structured practice list" placeholder in the
        common navigation view elements with a custom category that contains the "technical" and "management"
        tag-based-query custom&nbsp;categories. This way, if you add a new technical practice, you just have to tag the
        practice element with "technical" and it will appear correctly in the view.&nbsp; <em><u>[*** I checked and none of
        the practice release information is tagged.&nbsp; ***]</u></em>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These tag-based-query custom categories are defined in the commercial-level extensions to the base navigation view
    definition plug-in.&nbsp; These new custom categories are defined to replace the non-query-based custom categories in
    the base navigation view definition plug-in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>
    Categorizing Method Elements Using Custom Categories
</h3>
<p>
    Custom categories can be used to categorize method elements so that the practitioners can find them easily and quickly.
    They also form the basis of a published configuration by defining the navigation view&nbsp;structure for the
    configuration.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Custom categories are highly customizable and can contain any type of element. Custom categories allow you to
    categorize content according to any hierarchical scheme you want and can then be used to compose publishable views, as
    well as providing a means to organize the method content prior to publishing. For example, you could create a <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/custom_category_554AC4D6.html" guid="_eqw94MaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">custom category</a>&nbsp;that logically organizes content relevant to your development
    organization department, such as a Testing category that groups together all roles, work products, tasks, and guidance
    elements relevant to testing.
</p>
<p>
    When defining custom categories, consider the different ways you may want to access the elements, as well as the ways
    in which the end-user of the method may want to access the method elements.&nbsp; The former may result in ideas for
    "method management-focused" custom categories, while the latter may result in ideas for navigation view focused custom
    categories. What information is needed? How does one find that information? Well crafted custom categories will help
    enormously.
</p>
<p>
    Custom categories can be nested to create a categorization hierarchy. For example, if you want to define a navigation
    view that includes "sub-folders", you can do that by defining a sub-custom category in a navigation view custom
    category for each folder you would like to be included.
</p>
<p>
    Custom categories can also be nested to organize the custom categories.&nbsp;For example, if you define a set of custom
    categories that are intended to represent navigation views and another set that are not.&nbsp;You may want to package
    all the navigation view custom categories in a single custom category.&nbsp;In this case, the topmost custom category
    is more like a package than a custom category.
</p>
<p>
    You can add elements to existing categories by defining a custom category that contributes to the original custom
    category and adds the desired elements.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    For methods containing a lot of elements and plug-ins, defining a shared set of custom categories can be beneficial for
    the following reasons:<br />
    <br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Method authors have a consistent way of categorizing content
    </li>
    <li>
        Method authors and delivery practitioners can find related content more easily and reference it
    </li>
    <li>
        Published configurations will have the same look and feel to the delivery practitioner making the web site easier
        to navigate and information easier to find
    </li>
    <li>
        Delivery practitioners will require less education and training on the set of configurations with which they work
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    For recommendations on naming custom categories, see the topic Method Element Naming Conventions in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/general_naming_conventions_5651B0CC.html" guid="__I8S0D2kEd-lU6YVR9_PJQ">Guideline: General Naming Conventions</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Be sure to capture the purpose of the custom category in its description, so that the reason the custom category was
    created and what it contains is maintained.&nbsp;This will make it easy for other method authors to understand when the
    category should be used.
</p>
<p>
    Custom categories cannot be packaged in separate packages in plug-ins.&nbsp;Thus alternative categorization schemes
    must be defined in separate plug-ins.
</p>
<h3>
    Customizing a Custom Category
</h3>
<p>
    It is assumed that the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/custom_category_554AC4D6.html" guid="_eqw94MaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">custom category</a>&nbsp;being customized cannot be modified directly. Thus, all changes
    must be stored in a separate plug-in from the&nbsp;custom category being customized. To see the resulting changes, you
    need to browse or publish a configuration that includes the original custom category plus the customizations.
    If&nbsp;you can modify the custom category directly, you should follow the guidelines described&nbsp; above in
    Categorizing Method Elements Using Custom Categories.
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of different ways that you can customize an existing custom category.&nbsp;You can:&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Add elements to an existing custom category
    </li>
    <li>
        Re-order the elements in an existing custom category
    </li>
    <li>
        Replace an existing custom category
    </li>
    <li>
        Rename an existing custom category
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Specific custom category view customization scenarios are described in the remaining sections of this guideline.
</p>
<h4>
    Add elements to an existing custom category
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to add a method element to an existing custom category:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create a plug-in to contain the custom category customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define a custom category that contributes to the existing custom category. For more information
        on contribution, see the topic Using Method Content Variability in the <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.bus.mdev.base/guidances/guidelines/defining_method_elements_CADE4FF6.html" guid="_fx7TMD3REd-realK_We5vA">Guideline: Defining Method Elements</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the contributor, assign the elements you would like to see added to the category. If you want to add a
        sub-custom category to the category, define a sub-custom category. You can even control the order in which the
        elements appear in the category, relative to the existing elements.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Re-order the elements in an existing custom category
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to reorder the elements in an existing custom category:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create a plug-in to contain the custom category&nbsp;customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define a custom category and assign all the same elements as the original custom category.
        Re-order the elements in the custom category, as desired.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Change the definition of the new custom category to replace the original&nbsp;custom category&nbsp;using method
        content variability.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Replace an existing custom category
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to replace an existing custom category&nbsp;with a new custom category:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create a plug-in to contain the custom category&nbsp;customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define a custom category and assign all desired elements to the custom category. Re-order the
        elements in the custom category, as desired.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Change the definition of the new custom category to replace the original custom category using method content
        variability.&nbsp;
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Rename an existing custom category
</h4>
<p>
    Perform the following steps to rename an existing custom category:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If it does not already exist, create a plug-in to contain the custom category customizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        In the new plug-in, define a custom category that extends and replaces the existing custom category using method
        content variability.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
        Give the new custom category the desired presentation name.
    </li>
